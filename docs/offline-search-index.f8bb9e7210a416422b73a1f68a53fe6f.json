It consists of three main components: lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis, phylogenetics, comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, network biology and more. The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and course projects focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data using command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R. Depending on student interests, one or more specialty topics may be included, such as the analysis of single cell (e.g. scRNA-Seq) experiments, multi-omics data, or the development of web-based analysis tools (e.g. Shiny Apps).\nWho should take this class? Students with a strong interest and motivation in acquiring the skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern genome research. The class is mainly targeting graduate students but senior undergraduate students are welcome to enroll as well. The main audience of this class usually includes students from bioscience, biomedical and bioengineering programs as well as CS and statistics students with interest in computational biology.\nCan I audit this class? It is possible to audit this class. However, due to the emphasis on active participation in practicals and course projects, students usually learn much more if they enroll into the class rather than auditing it in a passive manner.\nInclusive Classroom Code of Conduct The instructors, organizers and participants of this class are committed to create and maintain an environment in which everyone can learn and thrive in ways inclusive of their diverse backgrounds and identities. All teaching material, activities, virtual or face-to-face interactions related to this course are intended to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, Veteran status, citizenship status, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Violations of this code of conduct should be reported to the main instructor (Thomas Girke, thomas.girke@ucr.edu). For additional information about this important topic please visit the website of UCR’s Office of Diversity, Equity \u0026 Inclusion (DEI).\nAccessibility UC Riverside is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body.

The class consists of three main components: lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis, phylogenetics, comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, network biology and more. The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and course projects focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data using command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R. Credit: 4 units (2x 1.5 hours lectures, 1 hour discussion)\nObjectives of course  Acquire understanding of algorithms used in bioinformatics Obtain hands-on experience in large scale data analysis.  Prerequisites The main prerequisite for this course is a strong interest in acquiring the skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern genome research.\nStructure of course Two lectures per week (1.5 hours each) plus one discussion section (1 hour). During the first weeks the discussion section will be used for data analysis tutorials using Linux command-line tools and R.\nTime Lecture: Tue/Thu 2:00-3:20 PM Discussion: Thu 3:30-4:20 PM\nLocation Online via video conferencing software\nGrading  Homework assignments: 40% Scientific paper presentation: 20% Course project presentations: 20% Final project report: 20%  Additional details about the grading system are provided in this table (see both tabs).\nGrading policy: Given the diverse educational background of the students in GEN242, all assignments are designed to be solvable by students from both experimental and quantitative disciplines, including those with no or only limited prior experience in programming and/or data modeling. The weight of each of the four gradable components in this class is given above in percent. (1) The homeworks include 8-10 assignments throughout the class. They cover algorithms and data analysis programming problems using the R language. The grading of these assignments is mainly based on correctness, reproducibility and reusability of the analysis code. (2-4) Students will work on a Challenge Project (individually or in group) addressing a specific data analysis problem in genome data sciences. As part of their project, students will present a scientific paper (2) closely related to their project (see reading list for details). The results of the Challenge Projects (3) will be presented and discussed by each student at the end of the course. In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report (4) of the assigned course project. The latter will be written in the style of a scientific publication and should include a detailed description of the results including all analysis code to fully reproduce the project results followed by a critical discussion of the outcomes. The grading of both the paper and project presentations (2-3) includes anonymous feedback from all students as well as the instructor, where understanding of the material, clarity of the oral presentations and critical thinking are the main grading criteria. The final project reports (4) will be graded by the instructor with an emphasis on scientific and coding accuracy, overall understanding of the topic, as well as reproducibility of the results.\nMaterials needed Students are expected to bring to each class meeting a laptop with a functional wireless connection and a recent internet browser version (e.g. Firefox, Chrome or Safari) preinstalled. Tablet computers with mobile operating systems are not suitable for running the required software. User accounts on a research computer cluster will be provided at the beginning of the course. To log in to the cluster, students also need to install a terminal application for their operating system (e.g. iTerm2 on OS X, and PuTTY or MobaXterm on Windows) as well as a file exchange software such as FileZilla. In addition, a recent version of R and RStudio should be installed.\nIf possible students may want to attend class sessions from a monitor setup with either one large monitor (wide enough to display several windows) or two separate monitors. This allows simultaneous viewing of presentations on one screen and following along hands-on practicals on the other screen.\nSchedule    Week Topic     Week 1 Course Introduction    Databases and Software for Genome Biology    Discussion: Introduction to Linux and HPC    Reading: A1, T1, T2   Week 2 Sequencing Technologies    Discussion: Introduction to R    Reading: A2-A4, T3   Week 3 Sequence Alignments and Searching    Multiple Sequence Alignments    Discussion: Programming in R and Parallel Evaluations    Reading: A5-A6, T4-T5   Week 4 Short Read Alignment Algorithms    Discussion: Basics of NGS Analysis    Reading: A7-A10, T6   Week 5 Gene Expression Analysis, Microarrays, bulk RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq    Discussion: NGS Workflow Overview; RNA-Seq Analysis    Reading: A11-A15, T7-T8   Week 6 Analysis of ChIP-Seq Experiments    Discussion: ChIP-Seq Analysis    Reading: A16-A18, T9-T10   Week 7 Students present publication related to their chosen course project    Discussion: Q\u0026A about papers    Reading: A19-A23   Week 8 Clustering algorithms    Pathway and GO annotation systems    Discussion: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis    Reading: A24-A26, T7 (Sec 3.14-3.15), T11   Week 9 Genome and Transcriptome Assembly Algorithms    Profile HMMs for Protein Family Modeling    Introduction to Phylogenetics    Discussion: Graphics and Data Visualization    Reading: A27-A29, T12   Week 10 Final presentations of student data analysis projects    Discussion: Tips and tricks for efficient data analysis programming    Reading: A30-A31, T3 (Sec 12,13-17)    Reading list Journal articles A1.

The HPCC website is available here.\nWhat Is a Computer Cluster?   A computer cluster is an assembly of CPU units, so called computer nodes that work together to perform many computations in parallel. To achieve this, an internal network (e.g. Infiniband interconnect) connects the nodes to a larger unit, while a head node controls the load and traffic across the entire system.\n  Usually, users log into the head node to submit their computer requests via srun to a queuing system provided by resource management and scheduling software, such as SGE, Slurm or TORQUE/MAUI. The queuing system distributes the processes to the computer nodes in a controlled fashion.\n  Because the head node controls the entire system, users should never run computing jobs on the head node directly!\n  For code testing purposes, one can log into one of the nodes with srun --pty bash -l and run jobs interactively. Alternatively, one can log into the test node owl via ssh.\n  Hardware Infrastructure Computer nodes  Over 8,000 CPU cores 130 Intel, AMD and GPU nodes 32-128 CPU cores per node 256-1,024 GB of RAM per node 12 GPU nodes, each with total of over 80,000 cuda cores  Interconnect  FDR IB @56Gbs  Storage  Parallel GPFS storage system with 3.0 PB usable space File system scales to over 50 PB Backup of same architecture and similar amount  User traffic  Computing tasks need to be submitted via sbatch or srun HPCC Cluster headnode only for login, not for computing tasks!

The meaning of this syntax is as follows:\n d: directory rwx: read, write and execute permissions, respectively  first triplet: user permissions (u) second triplet: group permissions (g) third triplet: world permissions (o)    Example for assigning write and execute permissions to user, group and world\nchmod ugo+rx my_file   + causes the permissions selected to be added - causes them to be removed = causes them to be the only permissions that the file has.  When performing the same operation on many files with subdirectories then one can use -R for recursive behavior.\nchmod -R ugo+rx my_dir  Since directories have to be executable the capital X option can be useful which applies only to directories but not to files. The following will assign drwxr-xr-x to directories and -rw-r--r-- to files and hidden files.\nchmod -R ugo-x,u+rwX,go+rX,go-w ./* ./.[!.]*  Syntax for changing user \u0026 group ownership\nchown \u003cuser\u003e:\u003cgroup\u003e \u003cfile or dir\u003e  Symbolic Links Symbolic links are short nicknames to files and directories that save typing of their full paths.\nln -s original_filename new_nickname  Software and module system  Over 2,000 software tools are currently installed on HPCC Cluster Custom installs in user accounts via various mechanisms, e.g. environment management systems such as conda Most common research databases used in bioinformatics are available Support of most common programming languages used in research computing A module system is used to facilitate the management of software tools. This includes any number of versions of each software. New software install requests can be sent to support@hpcc.ucr.edu. To use software manged under the module system, users need to learn using some basic commands. The most common commands are listed below.  Print available modules\nmodule avail  Print available modules starting with R\nmodule avail R  Load default module R\nmodule load R  Load specific module R version\nmodule load R/3.2.2  List loaded modules\nmodule list  Unload module R\nmodule unload R  Unload specific module R\nmodule unload R/3.2.3-dev  Big data storage Each user account on HPCC Cluster comes only with 20GB of disk space. Much more disk space is available in a dedicated bigdata directory. How much space depends on the subscription of each user group. The path of bigdata and bigdata-shared is as follows:\n /bigdata/labname/username /bigdata/labname/shared  All lab members share the same bigdata pool. The course number gen242 is used as labname for user accounts adminstered under GEN242 (here /bigdata/gen242/shared).\nThe disk usage of home and bigdata can be monitored on the HPCC Cluster Dashboard.\nQueuing system: Slurm HPCC Cluster uses Slurm as queuing and load balancing system. To control user traffic, any type of compute intensive jobs need to be submitted via the sbatch or srun (see below) to the computer nodes. Much more detailed information on this topic can be found on these sites:\n UCR HPCC Manual Slurm Documentation Torque/Slurm Comparison Switching from Torque to Slurm Slurm Quick Start Tutorial  Job submission with sbatch Print information about queues/partitions available on a cluster.\nsinfo  Compute jobs are submitted with sbatch via a submission script (here script_name.sh).\nsbatch script_name.sh  The following sample submission script (script_name.sh) executes an R script named my_script.R.\n#!/bin/bash -l #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G #SBATCH --time=1-00:15:00 # 1 day and 15 minutes #SBATCH --mail-user=useremail@address.com #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL #SBATCH --job-name=\"some_test\" #SBATCH -p batch # Choose queue/parition from: intel, batch, highmem, gpu, short Rscript my_script.R  STDOUTandSTDERROR of jobs will be written to files namedslurm-.outor to custom a file specified under#SBATCH –output` in the submission script.\nInteractive sessions with srun This option logs a user in to a computer node of a specified partition (queue), while Slurm monitors and controls the resource request.\nsrun --pty bash -l  Interactive session with specific resource requests\nsrun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 1:00:00 --pty bash -l  The argument --mem limits the amount of RAM, --cpus the number of CPU cores, --time the time how long a session will be active. Under --parition one can choose among different queues and node architectures. Current options under --partition for most users of the HPCC cluster are: intel, batch, highmem, gpu, and short. The latter has a time limit of 2 hours.\nMonitoring jobs with squeue List all jobs in queue\nsqueue  List jobs of a specific user\nsqueue -u \u003cuser\u003e  Print more detailed information about a job\nscontrol show job \u003cJOBID\u003e  Custom command to summarize and visualize cluster activity\njobMonitor  Deleting and altering jobs Delete a single job\nscancel -i \u003cJOBID\u003e  Delete all jobs of a user\nscancel -u \u003cusername\u003e  Delete all jobs of a certain name\nscancel --name \u003cmyJobName\u003e  Altering jobs with scontrol update.

Vi is guaranteed to be available on any system. Vim and Nvim (Neovim) are the improved versions of vi. Emacs: Non-graphical or window-based editor. You still need to know keystroke commands to use it. Installed on all Linux distributions and on most other Unix systems. Pico: Simple terminal-based editor available on most versions of Unix. Uses keystroke commands, but they are listed in logical fashion at bottom of screen. Nano: A simple terminal-based editor which is default on modern Debian systems. Atom: Modern text editor developed by GitHub project.  Why does it matter? To work efficiently on remote systems like a computer cluster, it is essential to learn how to work in a pure command-line interface. GUI environments like RStudio and similar coding environments are not suitable for this. In addition, there is a lot of value of knowing how to work in an environment that is not restricted to a specific programming language. Therefore, this class embraces RStudio where it is useful, but for working on remote systems like HPCC Cluster, it uses Nvim and Tmux. Both are useful for many programming languages. Combinded with the nvim-r plugin they also provide a powerful command-line working environment for R. The following provides a brief introduction to this environment.\nVim overview The following opens a file (here myfile) with nvim (or vim)\nnvim myfile.txt # for neovim (or 'vim myfile.txt' for vim)  Once you are in Nvim, there are three main modes: normal, insert and command mode. The most important commands for switching between the three modes are:\n i: The i key brings you from the normal mode to the insert mode. The latter is used for typing. Esc: The Esc key brings you from the insert mode back to the normal mode. :: The : key starts the command mode at the bottom of the screen.  Use the arrow keys to move your cursor in the text. Using Fn Up/Down key allows to page through the text quicker. In the following command overview, all commands starting with : need to be typed in the command mode. All other commands are typed in the normal mode after pushing the Esc key.\nImportant modifier keys to control vim/nvim\n :w: save changes to file. If you are in editing mode you have to hit Esc first. :q: quit file that has not been changed :wq: save and quit file :!q: quit file without saving any changes  Useful resources for learning vim/nvim  Interactive Vim Tutorial Official Vim Documentation HPCC Linux Manual  Nvim-R-Tmux essentials Terminal-based Working Environment for R: Nvim-R-Tmux.\n Nvim-R-Tmux IDE for R Basics Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows to split terminal windows and to detach/reattach to existing terminal sessions. Combinded with the nvim-r plugin it provides a powerful command-line working environment for R where users can send code from a script to the R console or command-line. Both tmux and the nvim-r plugin need to be installed on a system. On HPCC Cluster both are configured in each user account. If this is not the case then follow the quick configuration instructions given in the following subsection.\nQuick configuration in user accounts of UCR’s HPCC Skip these steps if Nvim-R-Tmux is already configured in your account. Or follow the detailed instructions to install Nvim-R-Tmux from scratch on your own system.\n Log in to your user account on HPCC and execute install_nvimRtmux. Alternatively, follow these step-by-step install commands. To enable the nvim-R-tmux environment, log out and in again. Follow usage instructions of next section.  Basic usage of Nvim-R-Tmux The official and much more detailed user manual for Nvim-R is available here. The following gives a short introduction into the basic usage of Nvim-R-Tmux:\n1. Start tmux session (optional)\nNote, running Nvim from within a tmux session is optional. Skip this step if tmux functionality is not required (e.g. reattaching to sessions on remote systems).\ntmux # starts a new tmux session tmux a # attaches to an existing session  2. Open nvim-connected R session\nOpen a *.R or *.Rmd file with nvim and intialize a connected R session with \\rf. This command can be remapped to other key combinations, e.g. uncommenting lines 10-12 in .config/nvim/init.vim will remap it to the F2 key. Note, the resulting split window among Nvim and R behaves like a split viewport in nvim or vim meaning the usage of Ctrl-w w followed by i and Esc is important for navigation.\nnvim myscript.R # or *.Rmd file  3. Send R code from nvim to the R pane\nSingle lines of code can be sent from nvim to the R console by pressing the space bar. To send several lines at once, one can select them in nvim’s visual mode and then hit the space bar. Please note, the default command for sending code lines in the nvim-r-plugin is \\l. This key binding has been remapped in the provided .config/nvim/init.vim file to the space bar. Most other key bindings (shortcuts) still start with the \\ as LocalLeader, e.g. \\rh opens the help for a function/object where the curser is located in nvim. More details on this are given below.\nImportant keybindings for nvim The main advantages of Neovim compared to Vim are its better performance and its built-in terminal emulator facilitating the communication among Neovim and interactive programming environments such as R. Since the Vim and Neovim environments are managed independently, one can run them in parallel on the same system without interfering with each other. The usage of Neovim is almost identical to Vim.\nNvim commands\n \\rf: opens vim-connected R session. If you do this the first time in your user account, you might be asked to create an R directory under ~/. If so approve this action by pressing y. spacebar: sends code from vim to R; here remapped in init.vim from default \\l :split or :vsplit: splits viewport (similar to pane split in tmux) gz: maximizes size of viewport in normal mode (similar to Tmux’s Ctrl-a z zoom utility) Ctrl-w w: jumps cursor to R viewport and back; toggle between insert (i) and command (Esc) mode is required for navigation and controlling the environment. Ctrl-w r: swaps viewports Ctrl-w =: resizes splits to equal size :resize \u003c+5 or -5\u003e: resizes height by specified value :vertical resize \u003c+5 or -5\u003e: resizes width by specified value Ctrl-w H or Ctrl-w K: toggles between horizontal/vertical splits Ctrl-spacebar: omni completion for R objects/functions when nvim is in insert mode. Note, this has been remapped in init.vim from difficult to type default Ctrl-x Ctrl-o. :h nvim-R: opens nvim-R’s user manual; navigation works the same as for any Vim/Nvim help document :Rhelp fct_name: opens help for a function from nvim’s command mode with text completion support Ctrl-s and Ctrl-x: freezes/unfreezes vim (some systems)  Important keybindings for tmux Pane-level commands\n Ctrl-a %: splits pane vertically Ctrl-a \": splits pane horizontally Ctrl-a o: jumps cursor to next pane Ctrl-a Ctrl-o: swaps panes Ctrl-a \u003cspace bar\u003e: rotates pane arrangement Ctrl-a Alt \u003cleft or right\u003e: resizes to left or right Ctrl-a Esc \u003cup or down\u003e: resizes to left or right  Window-level comands\n Ctrl-a n: switches to next tmux window Ctrl-a Ctrl-a: switches to previous tmux window Ctrl-a c: creates a new tmux window Ctrl-a 1: switches to specific tmux window selected by number  Session-level comands\n Ctrl-a d: detaches from current session Ctrl-a s: switch between available tmux sesssions $ tmux new -s \u003cname\u003e: starts new session with a specific name $ tmux ls: lists available tmux session(s) $ tmux attach -t \u003cid\u003e: attaches to specific tmux session $ tmux attach: reattaches to session $ tmux kill-session -t \u003cid\u003e: kills a specific tmux session Ctrl-a : kill-session: kills a session from tmux command mode that can be initiated with Ctrl-a :  Nvim IDEs for other languages For other languages, such as Bash, Python and Ruby, one can use the vimcmdline plugin for nvim (or vim). To install it, one needs to copy from the vimcmdline resository the directories ftplugin, plugin and syntax and their files to ~/.config/nvim/. For user accounts of UCR’s HPCC, the above install script install_nvimRtmux includes the install of vimcmdline (since 09-Jun-18).\nThe usage of vimcmdline is very similar to nvim-R. To start a connected terminal session, one opens with nvim a code file with the extension of a given language (e.g. *.sh for Bash or *.py for Python), while the corresponding interactive interpreter session is initiated by pressing the key sequence \\s (corresponds to \\rf under nvim-R). Subsequently, code lines can be sent with the space bar.

R is a powerful statistical environment and programming language for the analysis and visualization of data. The associated Bioconductor and CRAN package repositories provide many additional R packages for statistical data analysis for a wide array of research areas. The R software is free and runs on all common operating systems.\nWhy Using R?  Complete statistical environment and programming language Efficient functions and data structures for data analysis Powerful graphics Access to fast growing number of analysis packages Most widely used language in bioinformatics Is standard for data mining and biostatistical analysis Technical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs  Books and Documentation  simpleR - Using R for Introductory Statistics (John Verzani, 2004) - URL Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2005) - URL More on this see “Finding Help” section in UCR Manual - URL  R Working Environments    R Projects and Interfaces  Some R working environments with support for syntax highlighting and utilities to send code to the R console:\n RStudio: excellent choice for beginners (Cheat Sheet) Basic R code editors provided by Rguis gedit, Rgedit, RKWard, Eclipse, Tinn-R, Notepad++, NppToR Vim-R-Tmux: R working environment based on vim and tmux Emacs (ESS add-on package)  Example: RStudio New integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Highly functional for both beginners and advanced.\n   RStudio IDE  Some userful shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter (send code), Ctrl+Shift+C (comment/uncomment), Ctrl+1/2 (switch window focus)\nExample: Nvim-R-Tmux Terminal-based Working Environment for R: Nvim-R-Tmux.\n   Nvim-R-Tmux IDE for R  R Package Repositories  CRAN (\u003e14,000 packages) general data analysis - URL Bioconductor (\u003e2,000 packages) bioscience data analysis - URL Omegahat (\u003e90 packages) programming interfaces - URL RStudio packages - URL  Installation of R, RStudio and R Packages   Install R for your operating system from CRAN.\n  Install RStudio from RStudio.\n  Install CRAN Packages from R console like this:\ninstall.packages(c(\"pkg1\", \"pkg2\")) install.packages(\"pkg.zip\", repos=NULL)    Install Bioconductor packages as follows:\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"BiocManager\") # Installs BiocManager if not available yet BiocManager::version() # Reports Bioconductor version BiocManager::install(c(\"pkg1\", \"pkg2\")) # Installs packages specified under \"pkg1\"    For more details consult the Bioc Install page and BiocInstaller package.\n  Getting Around Startup and Closing Behavior   Starting R: The R GUI versions, including RStudio, under Windows and Mac OS X can be opened by double-clicking their icons. Alternatively, one can start it by typing R in a terminal (default under Linux).\n  Startup/Closing Behavior: The R environment is controlled by hidden files in the startup directory: .RData, .Rhistory and .Rprofile (optional).\n  Closing R:\n  q()  Save workspace image? [y/n/c]:   Note: When responding with y, then the entire R workspace will be written to the .RData file which can become very large. Often it is better to select n here, because a much better working pratice is to save an analysis protocol to an R or Rmd source file. This way one can quickly regenerate all data sets and objects needed in a future session.

The R programming syntax is extremely easy to learn, even for users with no previous programming experience. Once the basic R programming control structures are understood, users can use the R language as a powerful environment to perform complex custom analyses of almost any type of data (Gentleman 2008).\nWhy Programming in R?  Powerful statistical environment and programming language Facilitates reproducible research Efficient data structures make programming very easy Ease of implementing custom functions Powerful graphics Access to fast growing number of analysis packages One of the most widely used languages in bioinformatics Is standard for data mining and biostatistical analysis Technical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs  R Basics The previous Rbasics tutorial provides a general introduction to the usage of the R environment and its basic command syntax. More details can be found in the R \u0026 BioConductor manual here.\nCode Editors for R Several excellent code editors are available that provide functionalities like R syntax highlighting, auto code indenting and utilities to send code/functions to the R console.\n RStudio: GUI-based IDE for R Vim-R-Tmux: R working environment based on vim and tmux Emacs (ESS add-on package) gedit and Rgedit RKWard Eclipse Tinn-R Notepad++ (NppToR)   Programming in R using RStudio     Programming in R using Vim or Emacs    Finding Help Reference list on R programming (selection)\n Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham R Programming for Bioinformatics, by Robert Gentleman S Programming, by W.

(not)  Note: \u0026 and \u0026\u0026 indicate logical AND, while | and || indicate logical OR. The shorter form performs element-wise comparisons of same-length vectors. The longer form evaluates left to right examining only the first element of each vector (can be of different lengths). Evaluation proceeds only until the result is determined. The longer form is preferred for programming control-flow, e.g. via if clauses.\nConditional Executions: if Statements An if statement operates on length-one logical vectors.\nSyntax\nif (TRUE) { statements_1 } else { statements_2 }  In the else component, avoid inserting newlines between } else. For details on how to best and consistently format R code, this style guide is a good start. In addition, the formatR package can be helpful.\nExample\nif (1==0) { print(1) } else { print(2) }  ## [1] 2  Conditional Executions: ifelse Statements The ifelse statement operates on vectors.\nSyntax\nifelse(test, true_value, false_value)  Example\nx \u003c- 1:10 ifelse(x\u003c5, sqrt(x), 0)  ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000  Loops for loop for loops iterate over elements of a looping vector.\nSyntax\nfor(variable in sequence) { statements }  Example\nmydf \u003c- iris myve \u003c- NULL for(i in seq(along=mydf[,1])) { myve \u003c- c(myve, mean(as.numeric(mydf[i,1:3]))) } myve[1:8]  ## [1] 3.333333 3.100000 3.066667 3.066667 3.333333 3.666667 3.133333 3.300000  Note: Inject into objecs is much faster than append approach with c, cbind, etc.\nExample\nmyve \u003c- numeric(length(mydf[,1])) for(i in seq(along=myve)) { myve[i] \u003c- mean(as.numeric(mydf[i,1:3])) } myve[1:8]  ## [1] 3.333333 3.100000 3.066667 3.066667 3.333333 3.666667 3.133333 3.300000  Conditional Stop of Loops The stop function can be used to break out of a loop (or a function) when a condition becomes TRUE. In addition, an error message will be printed.\nExample\nx \u003c- 1:10 z \u003c- NULL for(i in seq(along=x)) { if (x[i] \u003c 5) { z \u003c- c(z, x[i]-1) } else { stop(\"values need to be \u003c 5\") } }  while loop Iterates as long as a condition is true.\nSyntax\nwhile(condition) { statements }  Example\nz \u003c- 0 while(z\u003c5) { z \u003c- z + 2 print(z) }  ## [1] 2 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 6  The apply Function Family apply Syntax\napply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ARGs)  Arguments\n X: array, matrix or data.frame MARGIN: 1 for rows, 2 for columns FUN: one or more functions ARGs: possible arguments for functions  Example\napply(iris[1:8,1:3], 1, mean)  ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## 3.333333 3.100000 3.066667 3.066667 3.333333 3.666667 3.133333 3.300000  tapply Applies a function to vector components that are defined by a factor.\nSyntax\ntapply(vector, factor, FUN)  Example\niris[1:2,]  ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa  tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)  ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 5.006 5.936 6.588  sapply, lapply and vapply The iterator functions sapply, lapply and vapply apply a function to vectors or lists. The lapply function always returns a list, while sapply returns vector or matrix objects when possible. If not then a list is returned. The vapply function returns a vector or array of type matching the FUN.VALUE. Compared to sapply, vapply is a safer choice with respect to controlling specific output types to avoid exception handling problems.\nExamples\nl \u003c- list(a = 1:10, beta = exp(-3:3), logic = c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)) lapply(l, mean)  ## $a ## [1] 5.5 ## ## $beta ## [1] 4.535125 ## ## $logic ## [1] 0.5  sapply(l, mean)  ## a beta logic ## 5.500000 4.535125 0.500000  vapply(l, mean, FUN.VALUE=numeric(1))  ## a beta logic ## 5.500000 4.535125 0.500000  Often used in combination with a function definition:\nlapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]])) sapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]])) vapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]]), FUN.VALUE=numeric(1))  Improving Speed Performance of Loops Looping over very large data sets can become slow in R. However, this limitation can be overcome by eliminating certain operations in loops or avoiding loops over the data intensive dimension in an object altogether. The latter can be achieved by performing mainly vector-to-vecor or matrix-to-matrix computations. These vectorized operations run in R often over 100 times faster than the corresponding for() or apply() loops. In addition, one can make use of the existing speed-optimized C-level functions in R, such as rowSums, rowMeans, table, and tabulate. Moreover, one can design custom functions that avoid expensive R loops by using vector- or matrix-based approaches. Alternatively, one can write programs that will perform all time consuming computations on the C-level.\nThe following code samples illustrate the time-performance differences among the different approaches of running iterative operations in R.\n1. for loop with append versus inject approach The following runs a for loop where the result is appended in each iteration with the c() function. The corresponding cbind and rbind for two dimensional data objects would have a similar performance impact as c().\nmyMA \u003c- matrix(rnorm(1000000), 100000, 10, dimnames=list(1:100000, paste(\"C\", 1:10, sep=\"\"))) results \u003c- NULL system.time(for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) results \u003c- c(results, mean(myMA[i,]))) user system elapsed 39.156 6.369 45.559  Now the for loop is run with an inject approach for storing the results in each iteration.\nresults \u003c- numeric(length(myMA[,1])) system.time(for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) results[i] \u003c- mean(myMA[i,])) user system elapsed 1.550 0.005 1.556  As one can see from the output of system.time, the inject approach is 20-50 times faster.\n2. apply loop versus rowMeans The following performs a row-wise mean calculation on a large matrix first with an apply loop and then with the rowMeans function.\nsystem.time(myMAmean \u003c- apply(myMA, 1, mean)) user system elapsed 1.452 0.005 1.456 system.time(myMAmean \u003c- rowMeans(myMA)) user system elapsed 0.005 0.001 0.006  Based on the results from system.time, the rowMeans approach is over 200 times faster than the apply loop.\n3. apply loop versus vectorized approach In this example row-wise standard deviations are computed with an apply loop and then in a vectorized manner.\nsystem.time(myMAsd \u003c- apply(myMA, 1, sd)) user system elapsed 3.707 0.014 3.721 myMAsd[1:4] 1 2 3 4 0.8505795 1.3419460 1.3768646 1.3005428 system.time(myMAsd \u003c- sqrt((rowSums((myMA-rowMeans(myMA))^2)) / (length(myMA[1,])-1))) user system elapsed 0.020 0.009 0.028 myMAsd[1:4] 1 2 3 4 0.8505795 1.3419460 1.3768646 1.3005428  The vector-based approach in the last step is over 200 times faster than the apply loop.\n4. Example of fast querying routine applied to a large matrix (a) Create a sample matrix The following lfcPvalMA function creates a test matrix containing randomly generated log2 fold changes (LFCs) and p-values (here: pval or FDRs) for variable numbers of samples or test results. In biology this dataset mimics the results of an analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from several contrasts arranged in a single matrix (or data.frame).\nlfcPvalMA \u003c- function(Nrow=200, Ncol=4, stats_labels=c(\"lfc\", \"pval\")) { set.seed(1410) assign(stats_labels[1], runif(n = Nrow * Ncol, min = -4, max = 4)) assign(stats_labels[2], runif(n = Nrow * Ncol, min = 0, max = 1)) lfc_ma \u003c- matrix(lfc, Nrow, Ncol, dimnames=list(paste(\"g\", 1:Nrow, sep=\"\"), paste(\"t\", 1:Ncol, \"_\", stats_labels[1], sep=\"\"))) pval_ma \u003c- matrix(pval, Nrow, Ncol, dimnames=list(paste(\"g\", 1:Nrow, sep=\"\"), paste(\"t\", 1:Ncol, \"_\", stats_labels[2], sep=\"\"))) statsMA \u003c- cbind(lfc_ma, pval_ma) return(statsMA[, order(colnames(statsMA))]) } degMA \u003c- lfcPvalMA(Nrow=200, Ncol=4, stats_labels=c(\"lfc\", \"pval\")) dim(degMA)  ## [1] 200 8  degMA[1:4,] # Prints first 4 rows of DEG matrix generated as a test data set  ## t1_lfc t1_pval t2_lfc t2_pval t3_lfc t3_pval t4_lfc t4_pval ## g1 -1.8476368 0.39486484 1.879310 0.7785999 0.1769551 0.9904342 0.1747932 0.9536679 ## g2 0.2542926 0.04188993 -1.629778 0.6379570 -1.9280792 0.6106041 -2.3599518 0.1950022 ## g3 3.4703657 0.73881357 2.047794 0.3129176 -3.8891714 0.1508787 3.7811606 0.2560303 ## g4 -2.8548158 0.99201512 -2.710385 0.1772805 1.0920515 0.2826038 3.9313225 0.5519854  (b) Organize results in list To filter the results efficiently, it is usually best to store the two different stats (here lfc and pval) in separate matrices (here two) where each has the same dimensions and row/column ordering. Note, in this case a list is used to store the two matrices.\ndegList \u003c- list(lfc=degMA[ , grepl(\"lfc\", colnames(degMA))], pval=degMA[ , grepl(\"pval\", colnames(degMA))]) names(degList)  ## [1] \"lfc\" \"pval\"  sapply(degList, dim)  ## lfc pval ## [1,] 100 100 ## [2,] 5 5  (c) Combinatorial filter With the above generated data structure of two complementary matrices it is easy to apply combinatorial filtering routines that are both flexible and time-efficient (fast). The following example queries for fold changes of at least 2 (here lfc \u003e= 1 | lfc \u003c= -1) plus p-values of 0.5 or lower. Note, all intermediate and final results are stored in logical matrices. In addition to boolean comparisons, one can apply basic mathematical operations, such as calculating the sum of each cell across many matrices. This returns a numeric matix of integers representing the counts of TRUE values in each position of the considered logical matrices. Subsequently, one can perform summary and filtering routines on these count-based matrices which is convenient when working with large numbers of matrices. All these matrix-to-matrix comparisons are very fast to compute and require zero looping instructions by the user.\nqueryResult \u003c- (degList$lfc \u003c= 1 | degList$lfc \u003c= -1) \u0026 degList$pval \u003c= 0.5 colnames(queryResult) \u003c- gsub(\"_.*\", \"\", colnames(queryResult)) # Adjust column names queryResult[1:4,]  ## t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 ## g1 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## g2 TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE ## g3 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## g4 FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE  (d) Extract query results  Retrieve row labels (genes) that match the query from the previous step in each column, and store them in a list.  matchingIDlist \u003c- sapply(colnames(queryResult), function(x) names(queryResult[queryResult[ , x] , x]), simplify=FALSE) matchingIDlist  ## $t1 ## [1] \"g2\" \"g5\" \"g11\" \"g16\" \"g19\" \"g22\" \"g24\" \"g30\" \"g31\" \"g39\" \"g45\" \"g50\" \"g55\" \"g58\" \"g60\" \"g63\" ## [17] \"g69\" \"g71\" \"g72\" \"g73\" \"g77\" \"g78\" \"g79\" \"g80\" \"g82\" \"g86\" \"g88\" \"g91\" \"g92\" \"g93\" \"g95\" ## ## $t2 ## [1] \"g2\" \"g8\" \"g11\" \"g12\" \"g13\" \"g15\" \"g21\" \"g26\" \"g28\" \"g34\" \"g39\" \"g40\" \"g46\" \"g53\" \"g55\" \"g58\" ## [17] \"g69\" \"g77\" \"g78\" \"g81\" \"g83\" \"g91\" \"g92\" \"g95\" \"g99\" ## ## $t3 ## [1] \"g4\" \"g5\" \"g10\" \"g12\" \"g20\" \"g23\" \"g29\" \"g34\" \"g42\" \"g47\" \"g51\" \"g55\" \"g56\" \"g58\" \"g59\" \"g71\" ## [17] \"g74\" \"g75\" \"g77\" \"g80\" \"g81\" \"g82\" \"g84\" \"g85\" \"g89\" \"g90\" \"g91\" \"g94\" \"g97\" \"g98\" \"g99\" ## ## $t4 ## [1] \"g2\" \"g6\" \"g7\" \"g16\" \"g18\" \"g19\" \"g20\" \"g21\" \"g23\" \"g24\" \"g29\" \"g41\" \"g43\" \"g44\" \"g48\" \"g60\" ## [17] \"g62\" \"g63\" \"g65\" \"g67\" \"g68\" \"g70\" \"g72\" \"g84\" \"g87\" \"g88\" \"g97\" ## ## $t5 ## [1] \"g2\" \"g3\" \"g11\" \"g12\" \"g13\" \"g21\" \"g23\" \"g24\" \"g26\" \"g27\" \"g30\" \"g31\" \"g34\" \"g40\" \"g50\" \"g53\" ## [17] \"g57\" \"g58\" \"g60\" \"g62\" \"g72\" \"g73\" \"g78\" \"g84\" \"g85\" \"g86\" \"g89\" \"g90\" \"g92\" \"g99\"  Return all row labels (genes) that match the above query across a specified number of columns (here 2).

In fact, most of the R software can be viewed as a series of R functions.\nSyntax to define function\nmyfct \u003c- function(arg1, arg2, ...) { function_body }  Syntax to call functions\nmyfct(arg1=..., arg2=...)  The value returned by a function is the value of the function body, which is usually an unassigned final expression, e.g.: return()\nFunction Syntax Rules General\n Functions are defined by  The assignment with the keyword function The declaration of arguments/variables (arg1, arg2, ...) The definition of operations (function_body) that perform computations on the provided arguments. A function name needs to be assigned to call the function.    Naming\n Function names can be almost anything. However, the usage of names of existing functions should be avoided.  Arguments\n It is often useful to provide default values for arguments (e.g.: arg1=1:10). This way they don’t need to be provided in a function call. The argument list can also be left empty (myfct \u003c- function() { fct_body }) if a function is expected to return always the same value(s). The argument ... can be used to allow one function to pass on argument settings to another.  Body\n The actual expressions (commands/operations) are defined in the function body which should be enclosed by braces. The individual commands are separated by semicolons or new lines (preferred).  Usage\n Functions are called by their name followed by parentheses containing possible argument names. Empty parenthesis after the function name will result in an error message when a function requires certain arguments to be provided by the user. The function name alone will print the definition of a function.  Scope\n Variables created inside a function exist only for the life time of a function. Thus, they are not accessible outside of the function. To force variables in functions to exist globally, one can use the double assignment operator: \u003c\u003c-  Examples Define sample function\nmyfct \u003c- function(x1, x2=5) { z1 \u003c- x1 / x1 z2 \u003c- x2 * x2 myvec \u003c- c(z1, z2) return(myvec) }  Function usage\nApply function to values 2 and 5\nmyfct(x1=2, x2=5)  ## [1] 1 25  Run without argument names\nmyfct(2, 5)  ## [1] 1 25  Makes use of default value 5\nmyfct(x1=2)  ## [1] 1 25  Print function definition (often unintended)\nmyfct  ## function(x1, x2=5) { ## z1 \u003c- x1 / x1 ## z2 \u003c- x2 * x2 ## myvec \u003c- c(z1, z2) ## return(myvec) ## } ## \u003cbytecode: 0x5865ccde4df0\u003e  Useful Utilities Debugging Utilities Several debugging utilities are available for R. They include:\n traceback browser options(error=recover) options(error=NULL) debug  The Debugging in R page provides an overview of the available resources.\nRegular Expressions R’s regular expression utilities work similar as in other languages. To learn how to use them in R, one can consult the main help page on this topic with ?regexp.\nString matching with grep The grep function can be used for finding patterns in strings, here letter A in vector month.name.\nmonth.name[grep(\"A\", month.name)]  ## [1] \"April\" \"August\"  String substitution with gsub Example for using regular expressions to substitute a pattern by another one using a back reference. Remember: single escapes \\ need to be double escaped \\\\ in R.\ngsub('(i.*a)', 'xxx_\\\\1', \"virginica\", perl = TRUE)  ## [1] \"vxxx_irginica\"  Interpreting a Character String as Expression Some useful examples\nGenerates vector of object names in session\nmyfct \u003c- function(x) x^2 mylist \u003c- ls() n \u003c- which(mylist %in% \"myfct\") mylist[n]  ## [1] \"myfct\"  Executes entry in position n as expression\nget(mylist[n])  ## function(x) x^2  get(mylist[n])(2)  ## [1] 4  Alternative approach\neval(parse(text=mylist[n]))  ## function(x) x^2  Replacement, Split and Paste Functions for Strings Selected examples\nSubstitution with back reference which inserts in this example _ character\nx \u003c- gsub(\"(a)\",\"\\\\1_\", month.name[1], perl=T) x  ## [1] \"Ja_nua_ry\"  Split string on inserted character from above\nstrsplit(x,\"_\")  ## [[1]] ## [1] \"Ja\" \"nua\" \"ry\"  Reverse a character string by splitting first all characters into vector fields\npaste(rev(unlist(strsplit(x, NULL))), collapse=\"\")  ## [1] \"yr_aun_aJ\"  Time, Date and Sleep Selected examples\nReturn CPU (and other) times that an expression used (here ls)\nsystem.time(ls())  ## user system elapsed ## 0 0 0  Return the current system date and time\ndate()  ## [1] \"Sat Feb 13 18:30:39 2021\"  Pause execution of R expressions for a given number of seconds (e.g. in loop)\nSys.sleep(1)  Example Import of Specific File Lines with Regular Expression The following example demonstrates the retrieval of specific lines from an external file with a regular expression. First, an external file is created with the cat function, all lines of this file are imported into a vector with readLines, the specific elements (lines) are then retieved with the grep function, and the resulting lines are split into vector fields with strsplit.\ncat(month.name, file=\"zzz.txt\", sep=\"\\n\") x \u003c- readLines(\"zzz.txt\") x[1:6]  ## [1] \"January\" \"February\" \"March\" \"April\" \"May\" \"June\"  x \u003c- x[c(grep(\"^J\", as.character(x), perl = TRUE))] t(as.data.frame(strsplit(x, \"u\")))  ## [,1] [,2] ## c..Jan....ary.. \"Jan\" \"ary\" ## c..J....ne.. \"J\" \"ne\" ## c..J....ly.. \"J\" \"ly\"  Calling External Software External command-line software can be called with system. The following example calls blastall from R\nsystem(\"blastall -p blastp -i seq.fasta -d uniprot -o seq.blastp\")  Running R Scripts Possibilities for Executing R Scripts R console source(\"my_script.R\")  Command-line Rscript my_script.R # or just ./myscript.R after making it executable R CMD BATCH my_script.R # Alternative way 1 R --slave \u003c my_script.R # Alternative way 2  Passing arguments from command-line to R Create an R script named test.R with the following content:\nmyarg \u003c- commandArgs() print(iris[1:myarg[6], ])  Then run it from the command-line like this:\nRscript test.R 10  In the given example the number 10 is passed on from the command-line as an argument to the R script which is used to return to STDOUT the first 10 rows of the iris sample data. If several arguments are provided, they will be interpreted as one string and need to be split in R with the strsplit function. A more detailed example can be found here.\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) R supports several systems for object-oriented programming (OOP). This includes an older S3 system, and the more recently introduced R6 and S4 systems. The latter is the most formal version that supports multiple inheritance, multiple dispatch and introspection. Many of these features are not available in the older S3 system. In general, the OOP approach taken by R is to separate the class specifications from the specifications of generic functions (function-centric system). The following introduction is restricted to the S4 system since it is nowadays the preferred OOP method for package development in Bioconductor. More information about OOP in R can be found in the following introductions:\n Vincent Zoonekynd’s introduction to S3 Classes Christophe Genolini’s S4 Intro Advanced Bioconductor Courses Programming with R by John Chambers R Programming for Bioinformatics by Robert Gentleman Advanced R online book by Hadley Wichham  Define S4 Classes 1. Define S4 Classes with setClass() and new() y \u003c- matrix(1:10, 2, 5) # Sample data set setClass(Class=\"myclass\", representation=representation(a=\"ANY\"), prototype=prototype(a=y[1:2,]), # Defines default value (optional) validity=function(object) { # Can be defined in a separate step using setValidity if(class(object@a)[1]!=\"matrix\") { return(paste(\"expected matrix, but obtained\", class(object@a))) } else { return(TRUE) } } )  The setClass function defines classes. Its most important arguments are\n Class: the name of the class representation: the slots that the new class should have and/or other classes that this class extends. prototype: an object providing default data for the slots. contains: the classes that this class extends. validity, access, version: control arguments included for compatibility with S-Plus. where: the environment to use to store or remove the definition as meta data.  2. Create new class instance The function new creates an instance of a class (here myclass).\nmyobj \u003c- new(\"myclass\", a=y) myobj  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 3 5 7 9 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 10  If evaluated the following would return an error due to wrong input type (data.frame instead of matrix).\nnew(\"myclass\", a=iris) # Returns error due to wrong input  The arguments of new are:\n Class: the name of the class ...: data to include in the new object with arguments according to slots in class definition  3. Initialization method A more generic way of creating class instances is to define an initialization method (more details below).\nsetMethod(\"initialize\", \"myclass\", function(.Object, a) { .Object@a \u003c- a/a .Object }) new(\"myclass\", a = y)  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 1 1 1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 1 1 1  4. Usage and helper functions The ‘@’ operator extracts the contents of a slot. Its usage should be limited to internal functions.\nmyobj@a  ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 3 5 7 9 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 10  Create a new S4 object from an old one.\ninitialize(.Object=myobj, a=as.matrix(cars[1:2,]))  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## speed dist ## 1 1 1 ## 2 1 1  If evaluated the removeClass function removes an object from the current session. This does not apply to associated methods.\nremoveClass(\"myclass\")  5. Inheritance Inheritance allows to define new classes that inherit all properties (e.g. data slots, methods) from their existing parent classes. The contains argument used below allows to extend existing classes. This propagates all slots of parent classes.\nsetClass(\"myclass1\", representation(a = \"character\", b = \"character\")) setClass(\"myclass2\", representation(c = \"numeric\", d = \"numeric\")) setClass(\"myclass3\", contains=c(\"myclass1\", \"myclass2\")) new(\"myclass3\", a=letters[1:4], b=letters[1:4], c=1:4, d=4:1)  ## An object of class \"myclass3\" ## Slot \"a\": ## [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ## ## Slot \"b\": ## [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ## ## Slot \"c\": ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ## ## Slot \"d\": ## [1] 4 3 2 1  getClass(\"myclass1\")  ## Class \"myclass1\" [in \".GlobalEnv\"] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: a b ## Class: character character ## ## Known Subclasses: \"myclass3\"  getClass(\"myclass2\")  ## Class \"myclass2\" [in \".GlobalEnv\"] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: c d ## Class: numeric numeric ## ## Known Subclasses: \"myclass3\"  getClass(\"myclass3\")  ## Class \"myclass3\" [in \".GlobalEnv\"] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: a b c d ## Class: character character numeric numeric ## ## Extends: \"myclass1\", \"myclass2\"  6. Coerce objects to another class The following defines a coerce method. After this the standard as(..., \"...\") syntax can be used to coerce the new class to another one.\nsetAs(from=\"myclass\", to=\"character\", def=function(from) as.character(as.matrix(from@a))) as(myobj, \"character\")  ## [1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" \"7\" \"8\" \"9\" \"10\"  7. Virtual classes Virtual classes are constructs for which no instances will be or can be created. They are used to link together classes which may have distinct representations (e.g. cannot inherit from each other) but for which one wants to provide similar functionality. Often it is desired to create a virtual class and to then have several other classes extend it. Virtual classes can be defined by leaving out the representation argument or including the class VIRTUAL as illustrated here:\nsetClass(\"myVclass\") setClass(\"myVclass\", representation(a = \"character\", \"VIRTUAL\"))  8. Introspection of classes Useful functions to introspect classes include:\n getClass(\"myclass\") getSlots(\"myclass\") slotNames(\"myclass\") extends(\"myclass2\")  Assign Generics and Methods Generics and methods can be assigned with the methods setGeneric() and setMethod().\n1. Accessor functions This avoids the usage of the @ operator.\nsetGeneric(name=\"acc\", def=function(x) standardGeneric(\"acc\"))  ## [1] \"acc\"  setMethod(f=\"acc\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x) { return(x@a) }) acc(myobj)  ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 3 5 7 9 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 10  2. Replacement methods  Using custom accessor function with acc \u003c- syntax.  setGeneric(name=\"acc\u003c-\", def=function(x, value) standardGeneric(\"acc\u003c-\"))  ## [1] \"acc\u003c-\"  setReplaceMethod(f=\"acc\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x, value) { x@a \u003c- value return(x) }) ## After this the following replace operations with 'acc' work on new object class acc(myobj)[1,1] \u003c- 999 # Replaces first value colnames(acc(myobj)) \u003c- letters[1:5] # Assigns new column names rownames(acc(myobj)) \u003c- letters[1:2] # Assigns new row names myobj  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## a b c d e ## a 999 3 5 7 9 ## b 2 4 6 8 10  Replacement method using [ operator, here [...] \u003c- syntax.  setReplaceMethod(f=\"[\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x, i, j, value) { x@a[i,j] \u003c- value return(x) }) myobj[1,2] \u003c- 999 myobj  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## a b c d e ## a 999 999 5 7 9 ## b 2 4 6 8 10  3. Behavior of bracket operator The behavior of the bracket [ subsetting operator can be defined as follows.\nsetMethod(f=\"[\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x, i, j, ..., drop) { x@a \u003c- x@a[i,j] return(x) }) myobj[1:2, 1:3] # Standard subsetting works now on new class  ## An object of class \"myclass\" ## Slot \"a\": ## a b c ## a 999 999 5 ## b 2 4 6  4. Print behavior A convient summary printing behavior for a new class should always be defined.\nsetMethod(f=\"show\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(object) { cat(\"An instance of \", \"\\\"\", class(object), \"\\\"\", \" with \", length(acc(object)[,1]), \" elements\", \"\\n\", sep=\"\") if(length(acc(object)[,1])\u003e=5) { print(as.data.frame(rbind(acc(object)[1:2,], ...=rep(\"...\", length(acc(object)[1,])), acc(object)[(length(acc(object)[,1])-1):length(acc(object)[,1]),]))) } else { print(acc(object)) } }) myobj # Prints object with custom method  ## An instance of \"myclass\" with 2 elements ## a b c d e ## a 999 999 5 7 9 ## b 2 4 6 8 10  5. Define custom methods The following gives an example for defining a data specific method, here randomizing row order of matrix stored in new S4 class.\nsetGeneric(name=\"randomize\", def=function(x) standardGeneric(\"randomize\"))  ## [1] \"randomize\"  setMethod(f=\"randomize\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x) { acc(x)[sample(1:length(acc(x)[,1]), length(acc(x)[,1])), ] }) randomize(myobj)  ## a b c d e ## b 2 4 6 8 10 ## a 999 999 5 7 9  6. Plotting method Define a graphical plotting method for new class and allow users to access it with R’s generic plot function.\nsetMethod(f=\"plot\", signature=\"myclass\", definition=function(x, ...) { barplot(as.matrix(acc(x)), ...) }) plot(myobj)  7. Utilities to inspect methods Important inspection methods for classes include:\n showMethods(class=\"myclass\") findMethods(\"randomize\") getMethod(\"randomize\", signature=\"myclass\") existsMethod(\"randomize\", signature=\"myclass\")  Building R Packages This section has been moved to a dedicated tutorial on R package development here.\nProgramming Exercises Exercise 1 for loop Task 1.1: Compute the mean of each row in myMA by applying the mean function in a for loop.\nmyMA \u003c- matrix(rnorm(500), 100, 5, dimnames=list(1:100, paste(\"C\", 1:5, sep=\"\"))) myve_for \u003c- NULL for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) { myve_for \u003c- c(myve_for, mean(as.numeric(myMA[i, ]))) } myResult \u003c- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for) myResult[1:4, ]  ## C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 mean_for ## 1 1.7988703 0.785864023 1.2763288 0.2950553 0.9858471 1.02839310 ## 2 -0.9683694 2.724133446 -0.8274809 -0.3208423 -0.4600894 0.02947028 ## 3 -1.1476365 -0.002864923 1.2573494 0.9574395 1.0390970 0.42067691 ## 4 -0.3476123 0.639676778 -1.4706145 -1.3904486 -0.1612300 -0.54604574  while loop Task 1.2: Compute the mean of each row in myMA by applying the mean function in a while loop.\nz \u003c- 1 myve_while \u003c- NULL while(z \u003c= length(myMA[,1])) { myve_while \u003c- c(myve_while, mean(as.numeric(myMA[z, ]))) z \u003c- z + 1 } myResult \u003c- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while) myResult[1:4, -c(1,2)]  ## C3 C4 C5 mean_for mean_while ## 1 1.2763288 0.2950553 0.9858471 1.02839310 1.02839310 ## 2 -0.8274809 -0.3208423 -0.4600894 0.02947028 0.02947028 ## 3 1.2573494 0.9574395 1.0390970 0.42067691 0.42067691 ## 4 -1.4706145 -1.3904486 -0.1612300 -0.54604574 -0.54604574  Task 1.3: Confirm that the results from both mean calculations are identical\nall(myResult[,6] == myResult[,7])  ## [1] TRUE  apply loop Task 1.4: Compute the mean of each row in myMA by applying the mean function in an apply loop\nmyve_apply \u003c- apply(myMA, 1, mean) myResult \u003c- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while, mean_apply=myve_apply) myResult[1:4, -c(1,2)]  ## C3 C4 C5 mean_for mean_while mean_apply ## 1 1.2763288 0.2950553 0.9858471 1.02839310 1.02839310 1.02839310 ## 2 -0.8274809 -0.3208423 -0.4600894 0.02947028 0.02947028 0.02947028 ## 3 1.2573494 0.9574395 1.0390970 0.42067691 0.42067691 0.42067691 ## 4 -1.4706145 -1.3904486 -0.1612300 -0.54604574 -0.54604574 -0.54604574  Avoiding loops Task 1.5: When operating on large data sets it is much faster to use the rowMeans function\nmymean \u003c- rowMeans(myMA) myResult \u003c- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while, mean_apply=myve_apply, mean_int=mymean) myResult[1:4, -c(1,2,3)]  ## C4 C5 mean_for mean_while mean_apply mean_int ## 1 0.2950553 0.9858471 1.02839310 1.02839310 1.02839310 1.02839310 ## 2 -0.3208423 -0.4600894 0.02947028 0.02947028 0.02947028 0.02947028 ## 3 0.9574395 1.0390970 0.42067691 0.42067691 0.42067691 0.42067691 ## 4 -1.3904486 -0.1612300 -0.54604574 -0.54604574 -0.54604574 -0.54604574  To find out which other built-in functions for basic calculations exist, type ?rowMeans.\nExercise 2 Custom functions Task 2.1: Use the following code as basis to implement a function that allows the user to compute the mean for any combination of columns in a matrix or data frame.

The latter are usually referred to as computer clusters. MPI is also supported For an overview of parallelization packages available for R see here One of the most comprehensive parallel computing environments for R is batchtools. Older versions of this package were released under the name BatchJobs (Bischl et al. 2015). batchtools supports both multi-core and multi-node computations with and without schedulers. By making use of cluster template files, most schedulers and queueing systems are supported (e.g. Torque, Sun Grid Engine, Slurm). The BiocParallel package (see here) provides similar functionalities as batchtools, but is tailored to use Bioconductor objects.  Reminder: Traditional Job Submission for R This topic is covered in more detail in other tutorials. The following only provides a very brief overview of this submission method.\n1. Create Slurm submission script, here called script_name.sh with:\n#!/bin/bash -l #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G #SBATCH --time=1-00:15:00 # 1 day and 15 minutes #SBATCH --mail-user=useremail@address.com #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL #SBATCH --job-name=\"some_test\" #SBATCH -p short # Choose queue/partition from: intel, batch, highmem, gpu, short Rscript my_script.R  2. Submit R script called my_script.R by above Slurm script with:\nsbatch script_name.sh  Parallel Evaluations on Clusters with batchtools  The following introduces the usage of batchtools for a computer cluster using SLURM as scheduler (workload manager). SLURM is the scheduler used by the HPCC at UCR. Similar instructions are provided in HPCC’s manual section covering batchtools here To simplify the evaluation of the R code on the following slides, the corresponding text version is available for download from here.  Hands-on Demo of batchtools Set up working directory for SLURM First login to your cluster account, open R and execute the following lines. This will create a test directory (here mytestdir), redirect R into this directory and then download the required files:\n slurm.tmpl .batchtools.conf.R  dir.create(\"mytestdir\") setwd(\"mytestdir\") download.file(\"https://bit.ly/3gZJBsy\", \"slurm.tmpl\") download.file(\"https://bit.ly/3nvSNHA\", \".batchtools.conf.R\")  Load package and define some custom function The following code defines a test function (here myFct) that will be run on the cluster for demonstration purposes.\nThe test function (myFct) subsets the iris data frame by rows, and appends the host name and R version of each node where the function was executed.

Important features include a uniform workflow interface across different data analysis applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters (Figure 1). The latter supports interactive job submissions and batch submissions to queuing systems of clusters. For instance, systemPipeR can be used with any command-line aligners such as BWA (Heng Li 2013; H. Li and Durbin 2009), HISAT2 (Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015), TopHat2 (Kim et al. 2013) and Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012), as well as the R-based NGS aligners Rsubread (Liao, Smyth, and Shi 2013) and gsnap (gmapR) (Wu and Nacu 2010). Efficient handling of complex sample sets (e.g. FASTQ/BAM files) and experimental designs are facilitated by a well-defined sample annotation infrastructure which improves reproducibility and user-friendliness of many typical analysis workflows in the NGS area (Lawrence et al. 2013).\nThe main motivation and advantages of using systemPipeR for complex data analysis tasks are:\n Facilitates the design of complex data analysis workflows Consistent workflow interface for different large-scale data types Makes NGS analysis with Bioconductor utilities more accessible to new users Simplifies usage of command-line software from within R Reduces the complexity of using compute clusters for R and command-line software Accelerates runtime of workflows via parallelization on computer systems with multiple CPU cores and/or multiple compute nodes Improves reproducibility by automating analyses and generation of analysis reports    Figure 1: Relevant features in systemPipeR. Workflow design concepts are illustrated under (A \u0026 B). Examples of systemPipeR’s visualization functionalities are given under (C). \nA central concept for designing workflows within the systemPipeR environment is the use of workflow management containers. They support the widely used community standard Common Workflow Language (CWL) for describing analysis workflows in a generic and reproducible manner, introducing SYSargs2 workflow control class (see Figure 2). Using this community standard in systemPipeR has many advantages. For instance, the integration of CWL allows running systemPipeR workflows from a single specification instance either entirely from within R, from various command-line wrappers (e.g., cwl-runner) or from other languages (, e.g., Bash or Python). systemPipeR includes support for both command-line and R/Bioconductor software as well as resources for containerization, parallel evaluations on computer clusters along with the automated generation of interactive analysis reports.\nAn important feature of systemPipeR's CWL interface is that it provides two options to run command-line tools and workflows based on CWL. First, one can run CWL in its native way via an R-based wrapper utility for cwl-runner or cwl-tools (CWL-based approach). Second, one can run workflows using CWL’s command-line and workflow instructions from within R (R-based approach). In the latter case the same CWL workflow definition files (e.g. *.cwl and *.yml) are used but rendered and executed entirely with R functions defined by systemPipeR, and thus use CWL mainly as a command-line and workflow definition format rather than execution software to run workflows. In this regard systemPipeR also provides several convenience functions that are useful for designing and debugging workflows, such as a command-line rendering function to retrieve the exact command-line strings for each data set and processing step prior to running a command-line.\nThis overview introduces the design of a new CWL S4 class in systemPipeR, as well as the custom command-line interface, combined with the overview of all the common analysis steps of NGS experiments.\nWorkflow design structure using SYSargs2 The flexibility of systemPipeR's workflow control class scales to any number of analysis steps necessary in a workflow. This can include variable combinations of steps requiring command-line or R-based software executions. The connectivity among all workflow steps is achieved by the SYSargs2 workflow control class (see Figure 3). This S4 class is a list-like container where each instance stores all the input/output paths and parameter components required for a particular data analysis step. SYSargs2 instances are generated by two constructor functions, loadWorkflow and renderWF, using as data input so called targets or yaml files as well as two cwl parameter files (for details see below). When running preconfigured workflows, the only input the user needs to provide is the initial targets file containing the paths to the input files (e.g. FASTQ) along with unique sample labels. Subsequent targets instances are created automatically. The parameters required for running command-line software is provided by the parameter (.cwl) files described below.\nTo support one or many workflow steps in a single container the SYSargsList class capturing all information required to run, control and monitor complex workflows from start to finish.\n  Figure 2: Workflow steps with input/output file operations are controlled by SYSargs2 objects. Each SYSargs2 instance is constructed from one targets and two param files. The only input provided by the user is the initial targets file. Subsequent targets instances are created automatically, from the previous output files. Any number of predefined or custom workflow steps are supported. One or many SYSargs2 objects are organized in an SYSargsList container.\nWorkflow Management with SYSargsList In systemPipeR allows to create (multi-step analyses) and run workflows directly from R or the command-line using local systems, HPC cluster or cloud platforms.\n  Figure 3: Workflow Management using SYSargsList.\nGetting Started Installation The R software for running systemPipeR can be downloaded from CRAN. The systemPipeR environment can be installed from the R console using the BiocManager::install command. The associated data package systemPipeRdata can be installed the same way. The latter is a helper package for generating systemPipeR workflow environments with a single command containing all parameter files and sample data required to quickly test and run workflows.\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"BiocManager\") BiocManager::install(\"systemPipeR\") BiocManager::install(\"systemPipeRdata\")  Please note that if you desire to use a third-party command line tool, the particular tool and dependencies need to be installed and executable. See details.\nLoading package and documentation library(\"systemPipeR\") # Loads the package library(help = \"systemPipeR\") # Lists package info vignette(\"systemPipeR\") # Opens vignette  Load sample data and workflow templates The mini sample FASTQ files used by this overview vignette as well as the associated workflow reporting vignettes can be loaded via the systemPipeRdata package as shown below. The chosen data set SRP010938 obtains 18 paired-end (PE) read sets from Arabidposis thaliana (Howard et al. 2013). To minimize processing time during testing, each FASTQ file has been subsetted to 90,000-100,000 randomly sampled PE reads that map to the first 100,000 nucleotides of each chromosome of the A. thalina genome. The corresponding reference genome sequence (FASTA) and its GFF annotation files (provided in the same download) have been truncated accordingly. This way the entire test sample data set requires less than 200MB disk storage space. A PE read set has been chosen for this test data set for flexibility, because it can be used for testing both types of analysis routines requiring either SE (single-end) reads or PE reads.\nThe following generates a fully populated systemPipeR workflow environment (here for RNA-Seq) in the current working directory of an R session. At this time the package includes workflow templates for RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq, and Ribo-Seq. Templates for additional NGS applications will be provided in the future.\nDirectory structure The working environment of the sample data loaded in the previous step contains the following pre-configured directory structure (Figure 4). Directory names are indicated in green. Users can change this structure as needed, but need to adjust the code in their workflows accordingly.\n workflow/ (e.g. rnaseq/)  This is the root directory of the R session running the workflow. Run script ( *.Rmd) and sample annotation (targets.txt) files are located here. Note, this directory can have any name (e.g. rnaseq, varseq). Changing its name does not require any modifications in the run script(s). Important subdirectories:  param/  Stores non-CWL parameter files such as: *.param, *.tmpl and *.run.sh. These files are only required for backwards compatibility to run old workflows using the previous custom command-line interface. param/cwl/: This subdirectory stores all the CWL parameter files. To organize workflows, each can have its own subdirectory, where all CWL param and input.yml files need to be in the same subdirectory.   data/   FASTQ files FASTA file of reference (e.g. reference genome) Annotation files etc.   results/  Analysis results are usually written to this directory, including: alignment, variant and peak files (BAM, VCF, BED); tabular result files; and image/plot files Note, the user has the option to organize results files for a given sample and analysis step in a separate subdirectory.          Figure 5: systemPipeR’s preconfigured directory structure.\nThe following parameter files are included in each workflow template:\n targets.txt: initial one provided by user; downstream targets_*.txt files are generated automatically *.param/cwl: defines parameter for input/output file operations, e.g.:  hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.cwl hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.yml   *_run.sh: optional bash scripts Configuration files for computer cluster environments (skip on single machines):  .batchtools.conf.R: defines the type of scheduler for batchtools pointing to template file of cluster, and located in user’s home directory *.tmpl: specifies parameters of scheduler used by a system, e.g. Torque, SGE, Slurm, etc.    Structure of targets file The targets file defines all input files (e.g. FASTQ, BAM, BCF) and sample comparisons of an analysis workflow. The following shows the format of a sample targets file included in the package. It also can be viewed and downloaded from systemPipeR’s GitHub repository here. In a target file with a single type of input files, here FASTQ files of single-end (SE) reads, the first three columns are mandatory including their column names, while it is four mandatory columns for FASTQ files of PE reads. All subsequent columns are optional and any number of additional columns can be added as needed. The columns in targets files are expected to be tab separated (TSV format). The SampleName column contains usually short labels for referencing samples (here FASTQ files) accross many workflow steps (e.g. plots and column titles). Importantly, the labels used in the SampleName column need to be unique, while technical or biological replicates are indicated by duplicated values under the Factor column. For readability and transparency, it is useful to use here a short, consistent and informative syntax for naming samples and replicates. To avoid problems with other packages or external software, it is recommended to use the basic naming rules for R objects and their components as outlined here. This is important since the values used under the SampleName and Factor columns are intended to be used as labels for naming columns or plotting features in downstream analysis steps.\nUsers should note here, the usage of targets files is optional when using systemPipeR’s new CWL interface. They can be replaced by a standard YAML input file used by CWL. Since for organizing experimental variables targets files are extremely useful and user-friendly. Thus, we encourage users to keep using them.\nStructure of targets file for single-end (SE) samples library(systemPipeR) targetspath \u003c- system.file(\"extdata\", \"targets.txt\", package = \"systemPipeR\") read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = \"#\")[1:4, ]  ## FileName SampleName Factor SampleLong Experiment ## 1 ./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz M1A M1 Mock.1h.A 1 ## 2 ./data/SRR446028_1.fastq.gz M1B M1 Mock.1h.B 1 ## 3 ./data/SRR446029_1.fastq.gz A1A A1 Avr.1h.A 1 ## 4 ./data/SRR446030_1.fastq.gz A1B A1 Avr.1h.B 1 ## Date ## 1 23-Mar-2012 ## 2 23-Mar-2012 ## 3 23-Mar-2012 ## 4 23-Mar-2012  To work with custom data, users need to generate a targets file containing the paths to their own FASTQ files and then provide under targetspath the path to the corresponding targets file.\nStructure of targets file for paired-end (PE) samples For paired-end (PE) samples, the structure of the targets file is similar, where users need to provide two FASTQ path columns: FileName1 and FileName2 with the paths to the PE FASTQ files.\ntargetspath \u003c- system.file(\"extdata\", \"targetsPE.txt\", package = \"systemPipeR\") read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = \"#\")[1:2, 1:6]  ## FileName1 FileName2 SampleName Factor ## 1 ./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz ./data/SRR446027_2.fastq.gz M1A M1 ## 2 ./data/SRR446028_1.fastq.gz ./data/SRR446028_2.fastq.gz M1B M1 ## SampleLong Experiment ## 1 Mock.1h.A 1 ## 2 Mock.1h.B 1  Sample comparisons Sample comparisons are defined in the header lines of the targets file starting with ‘# \u003cCMP\u003e.’\nreadLines(targetspath)[1:4]  ## [1] \"# Project ID: Arabidopsis - Pseudomonas alternative splicing study (SRA: SRP010938; PMID: 24098335)\" ## [2] \"# The following line(s) allow to specify the contrasts needed for comparative analyses, such as DEG identification.

The SYSargs2 object is created and fully populated with the loadWF and renderWF functions, respectively.\nIn CWL, files with the extension .cwl define the parameters of a chosen command-line step or workflow, while files with the extension .yml define the input variables of command-line steps. Note, input variables provided by a targets file can be passed on to a SYSargs2 instance via the inputvars argument of the renderWF function.\nThe following imports a .cwl file (here hisat2-mapping-se.cwl) for running the short read aligner HISAT2 (Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015). The loadWF and renderWF functions render the proper command-line strings for each sample and software tool.\nlibrary(systemPipeR) targets \u003c- system.file(\"extdata\", \"targets.txt\", package = \"systemPipeR\") dir_path \u003c- system.file(\"extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se\", package = \"systemPipeR\") WF \u003c- loadWF(targets = targets, wf_file = \"hisat2-mapping-se.cwl\", input_file = \"hisat2-mapping-se.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) WF \u003c- renderWF(WF, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\"))  Several accessor methods are available that are named after the slot names of the SYSargs2 object.\nnames(WF)  ## [1] \"targets\" \"targetsheader\" \"modules\" \"wf\" ## [5] \"clt\" \"yamlinput\" \"cmdlist\" \"input\" ## [9] \"output\" \"cwlfiles\" \"inputvars\"  Of particular interest is the cmdlist() method. It constructs the system commands for running command-line software as specified by a given .cwl file combined with the paths to the input samples (e.g. FASTQ files) provided by a targets file. The example below shows the cmdlist() output for running HISAT2 on the first SE read sample. Evaluating the output of cmdlist() can be very helpful for designing and debugging .cwl files of new command-line software or changing the parameter settings of existing ones.\ncmdlist(WF)[1]  ## $M1A ## $M1A$`hisat2-mapping-se` ## [1] \"hisat2 -S ./results/M1A.sam -x ./data/tair10.fasta -k 1 --min-intronlen 30 --max-intronlen 3000 -U ./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz --threads 4\"  The output components of SYSargs2 define the expected output files for each step in the workflow; some of which are the input for the next workflow step, here next SYSargs2 instance (see Figure 2).\noutput(WF)[1]  ## $M1A ## $M1A$`hisat2-mapping-se` ## [1] \"./results/M1A.sam\"  modules(WF)  ## module1 ## \"hisat2/2.1.0\"  targets(WF)[1]  ## $M1A ## $M1A$FileName ## [1] \"./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz\" ## ## $M1A$SampleName ## [1] \"M1A\" ## ## $M1A$Factor ## [1] \"M1\" ## ## $M1A$SampleLong ## [1] \"Mock.1h.A\" ## ## $M1A$Experiment ## [1] 1 ## ## $M1A$Date ## [1] \"23-Mar-2012\"  targets.as.df(targets(WF))[1:4, 1:4]  ## FileName SampleName Factor SampleLong ## 1 ./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz M1A M1 Mock.1h.A ## 2 ./data/SRR446028_1.fastq.gz M1B M1 Mock.1h.B ## 3 ./data/SRR446029_1.fastq.gz A1A A1 Avr.1h.A ## 4 ./data/SRR446030_1.fastq.gz A1B A1 Avr.1h.B  output(WF)[1]  ## $M1A ## $M1A$`hisat2-mapping-se` ## [1] \"./results/M1A.sam\"  cwlfiles(WF)  ## $cwl ## [1] \"/home/tgirke/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/systemPipeR/extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.cwl\" ## ## $yml ## [1] \"/home/tgirke/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/systemPipeR/extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.yml\" ## ## $steps ## [1] \"hisat2-mapping-se\"  inputvars(WF)  ## $FileName ## [1] \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\" ## ## $SampleName ## [1] \"_SampleName_\"  In an ‘R-centric’ rather than a ‘CWL-centric’ workflow design the connectivity among workflow steps is established by writing all relevant output with the writeTargetsout function to a new targets file that serves as input to the next loadWorkflow and renderWF call. By chaining several SYSargs2 steps together one can construct complex workflows involving many sample-level input/output file operations with any combination of command-line or R-based software. Alternatively, a CWL-centric workflow design can be used that defines all/most workflow steps with CWL workflow and parameter files. Due to time and space restrictions, the CWL-centric approach is not covered by this tutorial.\nThird-party software tools Current, systemPipeR provides the param file templates for third-party software tools.

To make sure if the configuration is correct, on test it with:\ntryCL(command = \"hisat2\") ## 'All set up, proceed!'  Project initialization A SYSargsList object containing all relevant information for running a workflow (here RNA-Seq example) can be constructed as follows.\ngetwd() ## rnaseq script \u003c- \"systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd\" targetspath \u003c- \"targets.txt\" sysargslist \u003c- initWF(script = script, targets = targetspath)  Workflow execution To run workflows from R, there are several possibilities. First, one can run each line in an Rmd or R interactively, or use the runWF functions that allows to run workflows step-wise or from start to finish.\nsysargslist \u003c- configWF(x = sysargslist, input_steps = \"1:3\") sysargslist \u003c- runWF(sysargslist = sysargslist, steps = \"1:2\")  Alternatively, R pipes (%\u003e%) are supported to run individual workflow steps.\nsysargslist \u003c- initWF(script = \"systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd\", overwrite = TRUE) %\u003e% configWF(input_steps = \"1:3\") %\u003e% runWF(steps = \"1:2\")  How to run the workflow on a cluster This section of the tutorial provides an introduction to the usage of the systemPipeR features on a cluster.\nNow open the R markdown script *.Rmdin your R IDE (_e.g._vim-r or RStudio) and run the workflow as outlined below. If you work under Vim-R-Tmux, the following command sequence will connect the user in an interactive session with a node on the cluster. The code of the Rmd script can then be sent from Vim on the login (head) node to an open R session running on the corresponding computer node. This is important since Tmux sessions should not be run on the computer nodes.\nq(\"no\") # closes R session on head node  srun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 2:00:00 --pty bash -l module load R/4.0.3 R  Now check whether your R session is running on a computer node of the cluster and not on a head node.\nsystem(\"hostname\") # should return name of a compute node starting with i or c getwd() # checks current working directory of R session dir() # returns content of current working directory  Parallelization on clusters Alternatively, the computation can be greatly accelerated by processing many files in parallel using several compute nodes of a cluster, where a scheduling/queuing system is used for load balancing. For this the clusterRun function submits the computing requests to the scheduler using the run specifications defined by runCommandline.\nTo avoid over-subscription of CPU cores on the compute nodes, the value from yamlinput(args)['thread'] is passed on to the submission command, here ncpus in the resources list object. The number of independent parallel cluster processes is defined under the Njobs argument. The following example will run 18 processes in parallel using for each 4 CPU cores. If the resources available on a cluster allow running all 18 processes at the same time then the shown sample submission will utilize in total 72 CPU cores. Note, clusterRun can be used with most queueing systems as it is based on utilities from the batchtools package which supports the use of template files (*.tmpl) for defining the run parameters of different schedulers. To run the following code, one needs to have both a conf file (see .batchtools.conf.R samples here) and a template file (see *.tmpl samples here) for the queueing available on a system. The following example uses the sample conf and template files for the Slurm scheduler provided by this package.\nlibrary(batchtools) targetspath \u003c- system.file(\"extdata\", \"targetsPE.txt\", package = \"systemPipeR\") dir_path \u003c- system.file(\"extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-pe\", package = \"systemPipeR\") args \u003c- loadWorkflow(targets = targetspath, wf_file = \"hisat2-mapping-pe.cwl\", input_file = \"hisat2-mapping-pe.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName1 = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", FileName2 = \"_FASTQ_PATH2_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) resources \u003c- list(walltime = 120, ntasks = 1, ncpus = 4, memory = 1024) reg \u003c- clusterRun(args, FUN = runCommandline, more.args = list(args = args, make_bam = TRUE, dir = FALSE), conffile = \".batchtools.conf.R\", template = \"batchtools.slurm.tmpl\", Njobs = 18, runid = \"01\", resourceList = resources) getStatus(reg = reg) waitForJobs(reg = reg)  Workflow initialization with templates Workflow templates are provided via systemPipeRdata and GitHub.

The corresponding FASTQ files were downloaded from GEO (Accession: SRP010938). This data set contains 18 paired-end (PE) read sets from Arabidposis thaliana. The details about all download steps are provided here.\nUsers want to provide here additional background information about the design of their RNA-Seq project.\nExperimental design Typically, users want to specify here all information relevant for the analysis of their NGS study. This includes detailed descriptions of FASTQ files, experimental design, reference genome, gene annotations, etc.\nWorkflow environment NOTE: this section describes how to set up the proper environment (directory structure) for running systemPipeR workflows. After mastering this task the workflow run instructions can be deleted since they are not expected to be included in a final HTML/PDF report of a workflow.\n  If a remote system or cluster is used, then users need to log in to the remote system first. The following applies to an HPC cluster (e.g. HPCC cluster).\nA terminal application needs to be used to log in to a user’s cluster account. Next, one can open an interactive session on a computer node with srun. More details about argument settings for srun are available in this HPCC manual or the HPCC section of this website here. Next, load the R version required for running the workflow with module load. Sometimes it may be necessary to first unload an active software version before loading another version, e.g. module unload R.\n  srun --x11 --partition=gen242 --mem=20gb --cpus-per-task 8 --ntasks 1 --time 20:00:00 --pty bash -l module unload R; module load R/4.0.3_gcc-8.3.0  Load a workflow template with the genWorkenvir function. This can be done from the command-line or from within R. However, only one of the two options needs to be used.  From command-line\n$ Rscript -e \"systemPipeRdata::genWorkenvir(workflow='rnaseq')\" $ cd rnaseq  From R\nlibrary(systemPipeRdata) genWorkenvir(workflow = \"rnaseq\") setwd(\"rnaseq\")   Optional: if the user wishes to use another Rmd file than the template instance provided by the genWorkenvir function, then it can be copied or downloaded into the root directory of the workflow environment (e.g. with cp or wget).\n  Now one can open from the root directory of the workflow the corresponding R Markdown script (e.g. systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd) using an R IDE, such as nvim-r, ESS or RStudio. Subsequently, the workflow can be run as outlined below. For learning purposes it is recommended to run workflows for the first time interactively. Once all workflow steps are understood and possibly modified to custom needs, one can run the workflow from start to finish with a single command using rmarkdown::render() or runWF().\n  Load packages The systemPipeR package needs to be loaded to perform the analysis steps shown in this report (H Backman and Girke 2016). The package allows users to run the entire analysis workflow interactively or with a single command while also generating the corresponding analysis report. For details see systemPipeR's main vignette.\nlibrary(systemPipeR)  To apply workflows to custom data, the user needs to modify the targets file and if necessary update the corresponding parameter (.cwl and .yml) files. A collection of pre-generated .cwl and .yml files are provided in the param/cwl subdirectory of each workflow template. They are also viewable in the GitHub repository of systemPipeRdata (see here). For more information of the structure of the targets file, please consult the documentation here. More details about the new parameter files from systemPipeR can be found here.\nImport custom functions Custem functions for the challenge projects can be imported with the source command from a local R script (here challengeProject_Fct.R). Skip this step if such a script is not available. Alternatively, these functions can be loaded from a custom R package.\nsource(\"challengeProject_Fct.R\")  Experiment definition provided by targets file The targets file defines all FASTQ files and sample comparisons of the analysis workflow.

The paths to the resulting output FASTQ files are stored in the output slot of the SYSargs2 object. The following example performs adapter trimming with the trimLRPatterns function from the Biostrings package. After the trimming step a new targets file is generated (here targets_trim.txt) containing the paths to the trimmed FASTQ files. The new targets file can be used for the next workflow step with an updated SYSargs2 instance, e.g. running the NGS alignments using the trimmed FASTQ files.\nConstruct SYSargs2 object from cwl and yml param and targets files.\ndir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/preprocessReads/trim-pe\" trim \u003c- loadWorkflow(targets = targetspath, wf_file = \"trim-pe.cwl\", input_file = \"trim-pe.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) trim \u003c- renderWF(trim, inputvars = c(FileName1 = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", FileName2 = \"_FASTQ_PATH2_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) trim output(trim)[1:2]  preprocessReads(args = trim, Fct = \"trimLRPatterns(Rpattern='GCCCGGGTAA', subject=fq)\", batchsize = 1e+05, overwrite = TRUE, compress = TRUE) writeTargetsout(x = trim, file = \"targets_trim.txt\", step = 1, new_col = c(\"FileName1\", \"FileName2\"), new_col_output_index = c(1, 2), overwrite = TRUE)  FASTQ quality report The following seeFastq and seeFastqPlot functions generate and plot a series of useful quality statistics for a set of FASTQ files including per cycle quality box plots, base proportions, base-level quality trends, relative k-mer diversity, length and occurrence distribution of reads, number of reads above quality cutoffs and mean quality distribution.

The execution will be on a single machine without submitting to a queuing system of a computer cluster. This way, the input FASTQ files will be processed sequentially. By default runCommandline auto detects SAM file outputs and converts them to sorted and indexed BAM files, using internally the Rsamtools package. Besides, runCommandline allows the user to create a dedicated results folder for each workflow and a sub-folder for each sample defined in the targets file. This includes all the output and log files for each step. When these options are used, the output location will be updated by default and can be assigned to the same object.\n## Run single Machine args \u003c- runCommandline(args)  Parallelization on clusters Alternatively, the computation can be greatly accelerated by processing many files in parallel using several compute nodes of a cluster, where a scheduling/queuing system is used for load balancing. For this the clusterRun function submits the computing requests to the scheduler using the run specifications defined by runCommandline.\nTo avoid over-subscription of CPU cores on the compute nodes, the value from yamlinput(args)['thread'] is passed on to the submission command, here ncpus in the resources list object. The number of independent parallel cluster processes is defined under the Njobs argument. The following example will run 18 processes in parallel using for each 4 CPU cores. If the resources available on a cluster allow running all 18 processes at the same time then the shown sample submission will utilize in total 72 CPU cores. Note, clusterRun can be used with most queueing systems as it is based on utilities from the batchtools package which supports the use of template files (*.tmpl) for defining the run parameters of different schedulers. To run the following code, one needs to have both a conf file (see .batchtools.conf.R samples here) and a template file (see *.tmpl samples here) for the queueing available on a system. The following example uses the sample conf and template files for the Slurm scheduler provided by this package.\nlibrary(batchtools) resources \u003c- list(walltime = 120, ntasks = 1, ncpus = 4, memory = 1024) reg \u003c- clusterRun(args, FUN = runCommandline, more.args = list(args = args, make_bam = TRUE, dir = FALSE), conffile = \".batchtools.conf.R\", template = \"batchtools.slurm.tmpl\", Njobs = 18, runid = \"01\", resourceList = resources) getStatus(reg = reg) waitForJobs(reg = reg) args \u003c- output_update(args, dir = FALSE, replace = TRUE, extension = c(\".sam\", \".bam\")) ## Updates the output(args) to the right location in the subfolders output(args)  Check whether all BAM files have been created.\noutpaths \u003c- subsetWF(args, slot = \"output\", subset = 1, index = 1) file.exists(outpaths)  Read and alignment stats The following provides an overview of the number of reads in each sample and how many of them aligned to the reference.\nread_statsDF \u003c- alignStats(args = args) write.table(read_statsDF, \"results/alignStats.xls\", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\")  The following shows the alignment statistics for a sample file provided by the systemPipeR package.\nread.table(\"results/alignStats.xls\", header = TRUE)[1:4, ]  ## FileName Nreads2x Nalign Perc_Aligned Nalign_Primary ## 1 M1A 33609678 32136300 95.61621 32136300 ## 2 M1B 53002402 43620124 82.29839 43620124 ## 3 A1A 50223496 48438407 96.44571 48438407 ## 4 A1B 43650000 35549889 81.44304 35549889 ## Perc_Aligned_Primary ## 1 95.61621 ## 2 82.29839 ## 3 96.44571 ## 4 81.44304  Create symbolic links for viewing BAM files in IGV The symLink2bam function creates symbolic links to view the BAM alignment files in a genome browser such as IGV. The corresponding URLs are written to a file with a path specified under urlfile in the results directory.\nsymLink2bam(sysargs = args, htmldir = c(\"~/.html/\", \"somedir/\"), urlbase = \"http://cluster.hpcc.ucr.edu/~\u003cusername\u003e/\", urlfile = \"./results/IGVurl.txt\")  Read quantification Read counting with summarizeOverlaps in parallel mode using multiple cores Reads overlapping with annotation ranges of interest are counted for each sample using the summarizeOverlaps function (Lawrence et al. 2013). The read counting is preformed for exonic gene regions in a non-strand-specific manner while ignoring overlaps among different genes. Subsequently, the expression count values are normalized by reads per kp per million mapped reads (RPKM). The raw read count table (countDFeByg.xls) and the corresponding RPKM table (rpkmDFeByg.xls) are written to separate files in the directory of this project. Parallelization is achieved with the BiocParallel package, here using 8 CPU cores.\nlibrary(\"GenomicFeatures\") library(BiocParallel) txdb \u003c- makeTxDbFromGFF(file = \"data/tair10.gff\", format = \"gff\", dataSource = \"TAIR\", organism = \"Arabidopsis thaliana\") saveDb(txdb, file = \"./data/tair10.sqlite\") txdb \u003c- loadDb(\"./data/tair10.sqlite\") outpaths \u003c- subsetWF(args, slot = \"output\", subset = 1, index = 1) # (align \u003c- readGAlignments(outpaths[1])) # Demonstrates how # to read bam file into R eByg \u003c- exonsBy(txdb, by = c(\"gene\")) bfl \u003c- BamFileList(outpaths, yieldSize = 50000, index = character()) multicoreParam \u003c- MulticoreParam(workers = 4) register(multicoreParam) registered() counteByg \u003c- bplapply(bfl, function(x) summarizeOverlaps(eByg, x, mode = \"Union\", ignore.strand = TRUE, inter.feature = FALSE, singleEnd = FALSE)) countDFeByg \u003c- sapply(seq(along = counteByg), function(x) assays(counteByg[[x]])$counts) rownames(countDFeByg) \u003c- names(rowRanges(counteByg[[1]])) colnames(countDFeByg) \u003c- names(bfl) rpkmDFeByg \u003c- apply(countDFeByg, 2, function(x) returnRPKM(counts = x, ranges = eByg)) write.table(countDFeByg, \"results/countDFeByg.xls\", col.names = NA, quote = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\") write.table(rpkmDFeByg, \"results/rpkmDFeByg.xls\", col.names = NA, quote = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\")  Shows count table generated in previous step (countDFeByg.xls).

differential expression or abundance analysis methods, such as edgeR or DESeq2, the raw count values should be used as input. The usage of RPKM values should be restricted to specialty applications required by some users, e.g. manually comparing the expression levels among different genes or features.\nSample-wise correlation analysis The following computes the sample-wise Spearman correlation coefficients from the rlog transformed expression values generated with the DESeq2 package.

Alternatively, the gene-to-GO mappings can be obtained for many organisms from Bioconductor’s *.db genome annotation packages or GO annotation files provided by various genome databases. For each annotation this relatively slow preprocessing step needs to be performed only once. Subsequently, the preprocessed data can be loaded with the load function as shown in the next subsection.\nlibrary(\"biomaRt\") listMarts() # To choose BioMart database listMarts(host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") m \u003c- useMart(\"plants_mart\", host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") listDatasets(m) m \u003c- useMart(\"plants_mart\", dataset = \"athaliana_eg_gene\", host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") listAttributes(m) # Choose data types you want to download go \u003c- getBM(attributes = c(\"go_id\", \"tair_locus\", \"namespace_1003\"), mart = m) go \u003c- go[go[, 3] != \"\", ] go[, 3] \u003c- as.character(go[, 3]) go[go[, 3] == \"molecular_function\", 3] \u003c- \"F\" go[go[, 3] == \"biological_process\", 3] \u003c- \"P\" go[go[, 3] == \"cellular_component\", 3] \u003c- \"C\" go[1:4, ] dir.create(\"./data/GO\") write.table(go, \"data/GO/GOannotationsBiomart_mod.txt\", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\") catdb \u003c- makeCATdb(myfile = \"data/GO/GOannotationsBiomart_mod.txt\", lib = NULL, org = \"\", colno = c(1, 2, 3), idconv = NULL) save(catdb, file = \"data/GO/catdb.RData\")  Batch GO term enrichment analysis Apply the enrichment analysis to the DEG sets obtained the above differential expression analysis. Note, in the following example the FDR filter is set here to an unreasonably high value, simply because of the small size of the toy data set used in this vignette.

(2010) using for peak calling MACS2 where the uninduced sample serves as input (reference). The details about all download steps are provided here.\nUsers want to extend this section to provide all background information relevant for this ChIP-Seq project.\nExperimental design Typically, users want to specify here all information relevant for the analysis of their NGS study. This includes detailed descriptions of FASTQ files, experimental design, reference genome, gene annotations, etc.\nWorkflow environment NOTE: this section describes how to set up the proper environment (directory structure) for running systemPipeR workflows. After mastering this task the workflow run instructions can be deleted since they are not expected to be included in a final HTML/PDF report of a workflow.\n  If a remote system or cluster is used, then users need to log in to the remote system first. The following applies to an HPC cluster (e.g. HPCC cluster).\nA terminal application needs to be used to log in to a user’s cluster account. Next, one can open an interactive session on a computer node with srun. More details about argument settings for srun are available in this HPCC manual or the HPCC section of this website here. Next, load the R version required for running the workflow with module load. Sometimes it may be necessary to first unload an active software version before loading another version, e.g. module unload R.\n  srun --x11 --partition=gen242 --mem=20gb --cpus-per-task 8 --ntasks 1 --time 20:00:00 --pty bash -l module unload R; module load R/4.0.3_gcc-8.3.0  Load a workflow template with the genWorkenvir function. This can be done from the command-line or from within R. However, only one of the two options needs to be used.  From command-line\n$ Rscript -e \"systemPipeRdata::genWorkenvir(workflow='chipseq')\" $ cd chipseq  From R\nlibrary(systemPipeRdata) genWorkenvir(workflow = \"chipseq\") setwd(\"chipseq\")   Optional: if the user wishes to use another Rmd file than the template instance provided by the genWorkenvir function, then it can be copied or downloaded into the root directory of the workflow environment (e.g. with cp or wget).\n  Now one can open from the root directory of the workflow the corresponding R Markdown script (e.g. systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd) using an R IDE, such as nvim-r, ESS or RStudio. Subsequently, the workflow can be run as outlined below. For learning purposes it is recommended to run workflows for the first time interactively. Once all workflow steps are understood and possibly modified to custom needs, one can run the workflow from start to finish with a single command using rmarkdown::render() or runWF().\n  Load packages The systemPipeR package needs to be loaded to perform the analysis steps shown in this report (H Backman and Girke 2016). The package allows users to run the entire analysis workflow interactively or with a single command while also generating the corresponding analysis report. For details see systemPipeR's main vignette.\nlibrary(systemPipeR)  To apply workflows to custom data, the user needs to modify the targets file and if necessary update the corresponding parameter (.cwl and .yml) files. A collection of pre-generated .cwl and .yml files are provided in the param/cwl subdirectory of each workflow template. They are also viewable in the GitHub repository of systemPipeRdata (see here). For more information of the structure of the targets file, please consult the documentation here. More details about the new parameter files from systemPipeR can be found here.\nImport custom functions Custem functions for the challenge projects can be imported with the source command from a local R script (here challengeProject_Fct.R). Skip this step if such a script is not available. Alternatively, these functions can be loaded from a custom R package.\nsource(\"challengeProject_Fct.R\")  Experiment definition provided by targets file The targets file defines all FASTQ files and sample comparisons of the analysis workflow. If needed the tab separated (TSV) version of this file can be downloaded from here and the corresponding Google Sheet is here.\ntargetspath \u003c- \"targets_chipseq.txt\" targets \u003c- read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = \"#\") knitr::kable(targets)     FileName SampleName Factor SampleLong Experiment Date SampleReference     ./data/SRR038845_1.fastq.gz AP1_1 AP1 APETALA1 Induced 1 23-Mar-12    ./data/SRR038846_1.fastq.gz AP1_2A AP1 APETALA1 Induced 1 23-Mar-12    ./data/SRR038847_1.fastq.gz AP1_2B AP1 APETALA1 Induced 1 23-Mar-12    ./data/SRR038848_1.fastq.gz C_1A C Control Mock 1 23-Mar-12 AP1_1   ./data/SRR038849_1.fastq.gz C_1B C Control Mock 1 23-Mar-12 AP1_1   ./data/SRR038850_1.fastq.gz C_2A C Control Mock 1 23-Mar-12 AP1_2A   ./data/SRR038851_1.fastq.gz C_2B C Control Mock 1 23-Mar-12 AP1_2B    Read preprocessing Read quality filtering and trimming The following example shows how one can design a custom read preprocessing function using utilities provided by the ShortRead package, and then apply it with preprocessReads in batch mode to all FASTQ samples referenced in the corresponding SYSargs2 instance (trim object below). More detailed information on read preprocessing is provided in systemPipeR's main vignette.\nFirst, we construct SYSargs2 object from cwl and yml param and targets files.\ntrim \u003c- loadWF(targets = targetspath, wf_file = \"trim-se.cwl\", input_file = \"trim-se.yml\", dir_path = \"param/cwl/preprocessReads/trim-se\") trim \u003c- renderWF(trim, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) trim output(trim)[1:2]  Next, we execute the code for trimming all the raw data. Note, the quality settings are relatively relaxed in this step (Phred score of at least 10 and tolerating two Ns per read), because this data is from a time when the quality of Illumina sequencing was still low. Setting the quality parameter more stringent would remove too many reads, which would negatively impact the read coverage required for the downstream peak calling.\nfilterFct \u003c- function(fq, cutoff = 10, Nexceptions = 2) { qcount \u003c- rowSums(as(quality(fq), \"matrix\") \u003c= cutoff, na.rm = TRUE) fq[qcount \u003c= Nexceptions] # Retains reads where Phred scores are \u003e= cutoff with N # exceptions } preprocessReads(args = trim, Fct = \"filterFct(fq, cutoff=10, Nexceptions=2)\", batchsize = 1e+05) writeTargetsout(x = trim, file = \"targets_chip_trim.txt\", step = 1, new_col = c(\"FileName\"), new_col_output_index = 1, overwrite = TRUE)  FASTQ quality report The following seeFastq and seeFastqPlot functions generate and plot a series of useful quality statistics for a set of FASTQ files including per cycle quality box plots, base proportions, base-level quality trends, relative k-mer diversity, length and occurrence distribution of reads, number of reads above quality cutoffs and mean quality distribution.

The parameter settings of the aligner are defined in the bowtie2-index.cwl and bowtie2-index.yml files. In ChIP-Seq experiments it is usually more appropriate to eliminate reads mapping to multiple locations. To achieve this, users want to remove the argument setting -k 50 non-deterministic in the configuration files.\nBuilding the index:\nidx \u003c- loadWorkflow(targets = NULL, wf_file = \"bowtie2-index.cwl\", input_file = \"bowtie2-index.yml\", dir_path = \"param/cwl/bowtie2/bowtie2-idx\") idx \u003c- renderWF(idx) idx cmdlist(idx) ## Run in single machine runCommandline(idx, make_bam = FALSE)  The following submits 7 alignment jobs via a scheduler to a computer cluster.\ntargets \u003c- \"targets_chip_trim.txt\" dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/bowtie2/bowtie2-se\" args \u003c- loadWF(targets = targets, wf_file = \"bowtie2-mapping-se.cwl\", input_file = \"bowtie2-mapping-se.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) args cmdlist(args)[1:2] output(args)[1:2]  moduleload(modules(args)) # Skip if a module system is not used resources \u003c- list(walltime = 120, ntasks = 1, ncpus = 4, memory = 1024) reg \u003c- clusterRun(args, FUN = runCommandline, more.args = list(args = args, dir = FALSE), conffile = \".batchtools.conf.R\", template = \"batchtools.slurm.tmpl\", Njobs = 7, runid = \"01\", resourceList = resources) getStatus(reg = reg) waitForJobs(reg = reg) args \u003c- output_update(args, dir = FALSE, replace = TRUE, extension = c(\".sam\", \".bam\")) ## Updates the output(args) to the right location in the subfolders output(args)  Alternatively, one can run the alignments sequentially on a single system.

The corresponding URLs are written to a file with a path specified under urlfile, here IGVurl.txt. Please replace the directory and the user name. The following parameter settings will create a subdirectory under ~/.html called somedir of the user account. The user name under urlbase, here ttest, needs to be changed to the corresponding user name of the person running this function.\nsymLink2bam(sysargs = args, htmldir = c(\"~/.html/\", \"somedir/\"), urlbase = \"http://cluster.hpcc.ucr.edu/~\u003cusername\u003e/\", urlfile = \"./results/IGVurl.txt\")  Peak calling with MACS2 Merge BAM files of replicates prior to peak calling Merging BAM files of technical and/or biological replicates can improve the sensitivity of the peak calling by increasing the depth of read coverage. The mergeBamByFactor function merges BAM files based on grouping information specified by a factor, here the Factor column of the imported targets file. It also returns an updated SYSargs2 object containing the paths to the merged BAM files as well as to any unmerged files without replicates. This step can be skipped if merging of BAM files is not desired.\ndir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/mergeBamByFactor\" args \u003c- loadWF(targets = \"targets_bam.txt\", wf_file = \"merge-bam.cwl\", input_file = \"merge-bam.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_BAM_PATH_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) args_merge \u003c- mergeBamByFactor(args = args, overwrite = TRUE) writeTargetsout(x = args_merge, file = \"targets_mergeBamByFactor.txt\", step = 1, new_col = \"FileName\", new_col_output_index = 1, overwrite = TRUE, remove = TRUE)  Peak calling with input/reference sample MACS2 can perform peak calling on ChIP-Seq data with and without input samples (Zhang et al. 2008).\nThe following performs peak calling with input sample. The input sample can be most conveniently specified in the SampleReference column of the initial targets file. The writeTargetsRef function uses this information to create a targets file intermediate for running MACS2 with the corresponding input sample(s).\nwriteTargetsRef(infile = \"targets_mergeBamByFactor.txt\", outfile = \"targets_bam_ref.txt\", silent = FALSE, overwrite = TRUE) dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/MACS2/MACS2-input\" args_input \u003c- loadWF(targets = \"targets_bam_ref.txt\", wf_file = \"macs2-input.cwl\", input_file = \"macs2.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args_input \u003c- renderWF(args_input, inputvars = c(FileName1 = \"_FASTQ_PATH2_\", FileName2 = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) cmdlist(args_input)[1] ## Run MACS2 args_input \u003c- runCommandline(args_input, make_bam = FALSE, force = TRUE) outpaths_input \u003c- subsetWF(args_input, slot = \"output\", subset = 1, index = 1) file.exists(outpaths_input) writeTargetsout(x = args_input, file = \"targets_macs_input.txt\", step = 1, new_col = \"FileName\", new_col_output_index = 1, overwrite = TRUE)  The peak calling results from MACS2 are written for each sample to the results directory. They are named after the corresponding reference sample with extensions used by MACS2.\nAnnotate peaks with genomic context Annotation with ChIPseeker package To annotate the identified peaks with genomic context information one can use the ChIPpeakAnno or ChIPseeker package (Zhu et al. 2010; Yu, Wang, and He 2015). The following code uses the ChIPseeker package for annotating the peaks.\nlibrary(ChIPseeker) library(GenomicFeatures) dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/annotate_peaks\" args \u003c- loadWF(targets = \"targets_macs_input.txt\", wf_file = \"annotate-peaks.cwl\", input_file = \"annotate-peaks.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) txdb \u003c- makeTxDbFromGFF(file = \"data/tair10.gff\", format = \"gff\", dataSource = \"TAIR\", organism = \"Arabidopsis thaliana\") for (i in seq(along = args)) { peakAnno \u003c- annotatePeak(infile1(args)[i], TxDb = txdb, verbose = FALSE) df \u003c- as.data.frame(peakAnno) outpaths \u003c- subsetWF(args, slot = \"output\", subset = 1, index = 1) write.table(df, outpaths[i], quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\") } writeTargetsout(x = args, file = \"targets_peakanno.txt\", step = 1, new_col = \"FileName\", new_col_output_index = 1, overwrite = TRUE)  The peak annotation results are written to the results directory. The files are named after the corresponding peak files with extensions specified in the annotate_peaks.param file, here *.peaks.annotated.xls.\nCount reads overlapping peaks The countRangeset function is a convenience wrapper to perform read counting iteratively over serveral range sets, here peak range sets. Internally, the read counting is performed with the summarizeOverlaps function from the GenomicAlignments package. The resulting count tables are directly saved to files, one for each peak set.\nlibrary(GenomicRanges) dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/count_rangesets\" args \u003c- loadWF(targets = \"targets_macs_input.txt\", wf_file = \"count_rangesets.cwl\", input_file = \"count_rangesets.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) ## Bam Files targets \u003c- \"targets_chip_trim.txt\" dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/bowtie2/bowtie2-se\" args_bam \u003c- loadWF(targets = targets, wf_file = \"bowtie2-mapping-se.cwl\", input_file = \"bowtie2-mapping-se.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args_bam \u003c- renderWF(args_bam, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) args_bam \u003c- output_update(args_bam, dir = FALSE, replace = TRUE, extension = c(\".sam\", \".bam\")) outpaths \u003c- subsetWF(args_bam, slot = \"output\", subset = 1, index = 1) register(MulticoreParam(workers = 3)) bfl \u003c- BamFileList(outpaths, yieldSize = 50000, index = character()) countDFnames \u003c- countRangeset(bfl, args, mode = \"Union\", ignore.strand = TRUE) writeTargetsout(x = args, file = \"targets_countDF.txt\", step = 1, new_col = \"FileName\", new_col_output_index = 1, overwrite = TRUE)  Shows count table generated in previous step (C_1A_peaks.countDF.xls).

Differential binding analysis The runDiff function performs differential binding analysis in batch mode for several count tables using edgeR or DESeq2 (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010; Love, Huber, and Anders 2014).

Motif analysis Parse DNA sequences of peak regions from genome Enrichment analysis of known DNA binding motifs or de novo discovery of novel motifs requires the DNA sequences of the identified peak regions. To parse the corresponding sequences from the reference genome, the getSeq function from the Biostrings package can be used. The following example parses the sequences for each peak set and saves the results to separate FASTA files, one for each peak set. In addition, the sequences in the FASTA files are ranked (sorted) by increasing p-values as expected by some motif discovery tools, such as BCRANK.\nlibrary(Biostrings) library(seqLogo) library(BCRANK) dir_path \u003c- \"param/cwl/annotate_peaks\" args \u003c- loadWF(targets = \"targets_macs_input.txt\", wf_file = \"annotate-peaks.cwl\", input_file = \"annotate-peaks.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) args \u003c- renderWF(args, inputvars = c(FileName = \"_FASTQ_PATH1_\", SampleName = \"_SampleName_\")) rangefiles \u003c- infile1(args) for (i in seq(along = rangefiles)) { df \u003c- read.delim(rangefiles[i], comment = \"#\") peaks \u003c- as(df, \"GRanges\") names(peaks) \u003c- paste0(as.character(seqnames(peaks)), \"_\", start(peaks), \"-\", end(peaks)) peaks \u003c- peaks[order(values(peaks)$X.log10.pvalue., decreasing = TRUE)] pseq \u003c- getSeq(FaFile(\"./data/tair10.fasta\"), peaks) names(pseq) \u003c- names(peaks) writeXStringSet(pseq, paste0(rangefiles[i], \".fasta\")) }  Motif discovery with BCRANK The Bioconductor package BCRANK is one of the many tools available for de novo discovery of DNA binding motifs in peak regions of ChIP-Seq experiments.

Many of them are available as R packages on CRAN, Bioconductor and/or GitHub. Examples include PCA, MDS, SC3 (Kiselev et al. 2017), isomap, t-SNE (Donaldson and Donaldson 2010), FIt-SNE (Linderman et al. 2019), and UMAP (McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2018). In addition, some packages such as Bioconductor’s scater package provide in a single environment access to a wide range of embedding methods that can be conveniently and uniformly applied to Bioconductor’s S4 object class called SingleCellExperiment for handling scRNA-Seq data (Senabouth et al. 2019; Amezquita et al. 2020). The performance of the different embedding methods for scRNA-Seq data has been intensively tested by several studies, including Sun et al. (2019; 2020).\nFor illustration purposes, the following example code first applies four widely used embedding methods to a bulk RNA-Seq data set (Howard et al. 2013), and then to a much more complex scRNA-Seq data set (Aztekin et al. 2019) obtained from the scRNAseq package.\nBulk RNA-Seq data Generate SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment The following loads the bulk RNA-Seq data from Howard et al. (2013) into SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment objects. This is done by first creating a SummarizedExperiment object and then coercing it to a SingleCellExperiment object, as well as intializing the SingleCellExperiment directly.\nCreate SummarizedExperiment and coerce to SingleCellExperiment The required targetsPE.txt and countDFeByg.xls files can be downloaded from here.\nlibrary(SummarizedExperiment); library(SingleCellExperiment) targetspath \u003c- \"results/targetsPE.txt\" countpath \u003c- \"results/countDFeByg.xls\" targets \u003c- read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = \"#\") rownames(targets) \u003c- targets$SampleName countDF \u003c- read.delim(countpath, row.names=1, check.names=FALSE) (se \u003c- SummarizedExperiment(assays=list(counts=countDF), colData=targets))  ## class: SummarizedExperiment ## dim: 29699 18 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(29699): AT1G01010 AT1G01020 ...

When compiling R Markdown documents, the code components can be evaluated so that both the code and its output can be included in the final document. This makes analysis reports highly reproducible by allowing to automatically regenerate them when the underlying R code or data changes. R Markdown documents (.Rmd files) can be rendered to various formats including HTML and PDF. The R code in an .Rmd document is processed by knitr, while the resulting .md file is rendered by pandoc to the final output formats (e.g. HTML or PDF). Historically, R Markdown is an extension of the older Sweave/Latex environment. Rendering of mathematical expressions and reference management is also supported by R Markdown using embedded Latex syntax and Bibtex, respectively.\nQuick Start Install R Markdown install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")  Initialize a new R Markdown (Rmd) script To minimize typing, it can be helful to start with an R Markdown template and then modify it as needed. Note the file name of an R Markdown scirpt needs to have the extension .Rmd. Template files for the following examples are available here:\n R Markdown sample script: sample.Rmd Bibtex file for handling citations and reference section: bibtex.bib  Users want to download these files, open the sample.Rmd file with their preferred R IDE (e.g. RStudio, vim or emacs), initilize an R session and then direct their R session to the location of these two files.\nMetadata section The metadata section (YAML header) in an R Markdown script defines how it will be processed and rendered. The metadata section also includes both title, author, and date information as well as options for customizing the output format. For instance, PDF and HTML output can be defined with pdf_document and html_document, respectively. The BiocStyle:: prefix will use the formatting style of the BiocStyle package from Bioconductor.\n --- title: \"My First R Markdown Document\" author: \"Author: First Last\" date: \"Last update: 10 June, 2021\" output: BiocStyle::html_document: toc: true toc_depth: 3 fig_caption: yes fontsize: 14pt bibliography: bibtex.bib ---  Render Rmd script An R Markdown script can be evaluated and rendered with the following render command or by pressing the knit button in RStudio. The output_format argument defines the format of the output (e.g. html_document or pdf_document). The setting output_format=\"all\" will generate all supported output formats. Alternatively, one can specify several output formats in the metadata section.\nrmarkdown::render(\"sample.Rmd\", clean=TRUE, output_format=\"html_document\")  The following shows two options how to run the rendering from the command-line. To render to PDF format, use the argument setting: output_format=\"pdf_document\".\n$ Rscript -e \"rmarkdown::render('sample.Rmd', output_format='html_document', clean=TRUE)\"  Alternatively, one can use a Makefile to evaluate and render an R Markdown script. A sample Makefile for rendering the above sample.Rmd can be downloaded here. To apply it to a custom Rmd file, one needs open the Makefile in a text editor and change the value assigned to MAIN (line 13) to the base name of the corresponding .Rmd file (e.g. assign systemPipeRNAseq if the file name is systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd). To execute the Makefile, run the following command from the command-line.\n$ make -B  R code chunks R Code Chunks can be embedded in an R Markdown script by using three backticks at the beginning of a new line along with arguments enclosed in curly braces controlling the behavior of the code. The following lines contain the plain R code. A code chunk is terminated by a new line starting with three backticks. The following shows an example of such a code chunk. Note the backslashes are not part of it. They have been added to print the code chunk syntax in this document.\n ```\\{r code_chunk_name, eval=FALSE\\} x \u003c- 1:10 ```  The following lists the most important arguments to control the behavior of R code chunks:\n r: specifies language for code chunk, here R chode_chunk_name: name of code chunk; this name needs to be unique eval: if assigned TRUE the code will be evaluated warning: if assigned FALSE warnings will not be shown message: if assigned FALSE messages will not be shown cache: if assigned TRUE results will be cached to reuse in future rendering instances fig.height: allows to specify height of figures in inches fig.width: allows to specify width of figures in inches  For more details on code chunk options see here.\nLearning Markdown The basic syntax of Markdown and derivatives like kramdown is extremely easy to learn. Rather than providing another introduction on this topic, here are some useful sites for learning Markdown:\n R Markdown Online Book Markdown Intro on GitHub Markdown Cheet Sheet Markdown Basics from RStudio R Markdown Cheat Sheet kramdown Syntax  Tables There are several ways to render tables. First, they can be printed within the R code chunks. Second, much nicer formatted tables can be generated with the functions kable, pander or xtable. The following example uses kable from the knitr package.\nWith knitr::kable library(knitr) kable(iris[1:12,])     Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species     5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa   4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa   4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa   4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa   5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa   5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa   4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa   5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa   4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa   4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa   5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa   4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa    A much more elegant and powerful solution is to create fully interactive tables with the DT package. This JavaScirpt based environment provides a wrapper to the DataTables library using jQuery. The resulting tables can be sorted, queried and resized by the user.\nWith DT::datatable library(DT) datatable(iris, filter = 'top', options = list( pageLength = 100, scrollX = TRUE, scrollY = \"600px\", autoWidth = TRUE ))   {\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"filterHTML\":\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

Figures Plots generated by the R code chunks in an R Markdown document can be automatically inserted in the output file. The size of the figure can be controlled with the fig.height and fig.width arguments.\nlibrary(ggplot2) dsmall \u003c- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ] ggplot(dsmall, aes(color, price/carat)) + geom_jitter(alpha = I(1 / 2), aes(color=color))  Sometimes it can be useful to explicitly write an image to a file and then insert that image into the final document by referencing its file name in the R Markdown source. For instance, this can be useful for time consuming analyses. The following code will generate a file named myplot.png. To insert the file in the final document, one can use standard Markdown or HTML syntax, e.g.: \u003cimg src=\"myplot.png\"/\u003e.\npng(\"myplot.png\") ggplot(dsmall, aes(color, price/carat)) + geom_jitter(alpha = I(1 / 2), aes(color=color)) dev.off()  ## png ## 2    Inline R code To evaluate R code inline, one can enclose an R expression with a single back-tick followed by r and then the actual expression. For instance, the back-ticked version of ‘r 1 + 1’ evaluates to 2 and ‘r pi’ evaluates to 3.1415927.\nMathematical equations To render mathematical equations, one can use standard Latex syntax. When expressions are enclosed with single $ signs then they will be shown inline, while enclosing them with double $$ signs will show them in display mode. For instance, the following Latex syntax d(X,Y) = \\sqrt[]{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i}-y_{i})^2} } renders in display mode as follows:\n$$d(X,Y) = \\sqrt[]{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i}-y_{i})^2} }$$\nTo learn LaTeX syntax for mathematical equations, one can consult various online manuals, such as this Wikibooks tutorial, or use an online equation rendering and checking tool, such as this one.\nCitations and bibliographies Citations and bibliographies can be autogenerated in R Markdown in a similar way as in Latex/Bibtex. Reference collections should be stored in a separate file in Bibtex or other supported formats. To cite a publication in an R Markdown script, one uses the syntax [@\u003cid1\u003e] where \u003cid1\u003e needs to be replaced with a reference identifier present in the Bibtex database listed in the metadata section of the R Markdown script (e.g. bibtex.bib). For instance, to cite Lawrence et al. (2013), one uses its reference identifier (e.g. Lawrence2013-kt) as \u003cid1\u003e (Lawrence et al. 2013). This will place the citation inline in the text and add the corresponding reference to a reference list at the end of the output document. For the latter a special section called References needs to be specified at the end of the R Markdown script. To fine control the formatting of citations and reference lists, users want to consult this the corresponding R Markdown page. Also, for general reference management and outputting references in Bibtex format Paperpile can be very helpful.\nViewing R Markdown report on HPCC cluster R Markdown reports located on UCR’s HPCC Cluster can be viewed locally in a web browser (without moving the source HTML) by creating a symbolic link from a user’s .html directory. This way any updates to the report will show up immediately without creating another copy of the HTML file. For instance, if user ttest has generated an R Markdown report under ~/bigdata/today/rmarkdown/sample.html, then the symbolic link can be created as follows:\ncd ~/.html ln -s ~/bigdata/today/rmarkdown/sample.html sample.html  After this one can view the report in a web browser using this URL http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~ttest/rmarkdown/sample.html. If necessary access to the URL can be restricted with a password following the instructions here.\nSession Info sessionInfo()  ## R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.8.0 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.8.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] ggplot2_3.3.3 DT_0.18 knitr_1.33 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bslib_0.2.5.1 compiler_4.1.0 pillar_1.6.1 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [5] highr_0.9 tools_4.1.0 digest_0.6.27 viridisLite_0.4.0 ## [9] jsonlite_1.7.2 evaluate_0.14 lifecycle_1.0.0 tibble_3.1.2 ## [13] gtable_0.3.0 pkgconfig_2.0.3 rlang_0.4.11 DBI_1.1.1 ## [17] crosstalk_1.1.1 yaml_2.2.1 blogdown_1.3 xfun_0.23 ## [21] withr_2.4.2 dplyr_1.0.6 stringr_1.4.0 generics_0.1.0 ## [25] htmlwidgets_1.5.3 sass_0.4.0 vctrs_0.3.8 tidyselect_1.1.1 ## [29] grid_4.1.0 glue_1.4.2 R6_2.5.0 fansi_0.4.2 ## [33] rmarkdown_2.8 bookdown_0.22 farver_2.1.0 purrr_0.3.4 ## [37] magrittr_2.0.1 scales_1.1.1 htmltools_0.5.1.1 ellipsis_0.3.2 ## [41] assertthat_0.2.1 colorspace_2.0-1 labeling_0.4.2 utf8_1.2.1 ## [45] stringi_1.6.2 munsell_0.5.0 crayon_1.4.1  References Lawrence, Michael, Wolfgang Huber, Hervé Pagès, Patrick Aboyoun, Marc Carlson, Robert Gentleman, Martin T Morgan, and Vincent J Carey. 2013. “Software for Computing and Annotating Genomic Ranges.” PLoS Comput.

These include among many other annotation systems: Gene Ontology (GO), Disease Ontology (DO) and pathway annotations, such as KEGG and Reactome. Examples of widely used statistical enrichment methods are introduced as well. These statistical FEA methods assess whether functional annotation terms are over-represented in a query gene set. In case of so called over-represention analysis (ORA) methods, such as Fisher’s exact and hypergeometric distribution tests, the query is usually a list of unranked gene identifiers (Falcon and Gentleman 2007). In contrast to this, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithms use as query a score ranked lists (e.g. all genes profiled by an assay) and assess whether annotation categories are more highly enriched among the highest ranking genes compared to random rankings (Subramanian et al. 2005; Sergushichev 2016; Duan et al. 2020). The sets in both the query and the annotation databases can be composed of genes, proteins, compounds or other factors. For simplicity, the term gene sets is used throughtout this text.\nFunctional Annotations Systems This section introduces a small selection of functional annotation systems, largely provided by Bioconductor packages. This includes code to inspect how the annotations are organized and how to access them.\nGene Ontology DB GO.db is a data package that stores the GO term information from the GO consortium in an SQLite database. Several accessor functions are provided to query the database. Organism specific gene to GO annotations are provied by organism data packages and/or Bioconductor’s AnntationHub. The following provide sample code for using GO.db as well as a organism database example.\n## Load GOstats library library(GOstats); library(GO.db) ## Print complete GO term information for \"GO:0003700\" GOTERM$\"GO:0003700\" ## Print parent and children terms for a GO ID GOMFPARENTS$\"GO:0003700\"; GOMFCHILDREN$\"GO:0003700\" ## Print complete lineages of parents and children for a GO ID GOMFANCESTOR$\"GO:0003700\"; GOMFOFFSPRING$\"GO:0003700\" ## Print number of GO terms in each of the 3 ontologies zz \u003c- eapply(GOTERM, function(x) x@Ontology); table(unlist(zz)) ## Gene to GO mappings for an organism (here Arabidopsis) library(org.At.tair.db) # For human use org.Hs.eg.db xx \u003c- as.list(org.At.tairGO2ALLTAIRS)  Pathway DBs KEGG KEGG.db The following load_keggList function returns the pathway annotations from the KEGG.db package for a species selected under the org argument (e.g. hsa, ath, dme, mmu, …).

The resulting list object can be used for various ORA or GSEA methods, e.g. by fgsea.\n## Define function to create Reactome pathway list db load_reacList \u003c- function(org=\"R-HSA\") { library(reactome.db) reac_gene_list \u003c- as.list(reactomePATHID2EXTID) # All organisms in reactome reac_gene_list \u003c- reac_gene_list[grepl(org, names(reac_gene_list))] # Only human reac_name_list \u003c- unlist(as.list(reactomePATHID2NAME)) # All organisms in reactome reac_name_list \u003c- reac_name_list[names(reac_gene_list)] names(reac_gene_list) \u003c- paste0(names(reac_gene_list), \" (\", names(reac_name_list), \") - \", gsub(\"^.*: \", \"\", reac_name_list)) return(reac_gene_list) } ## Usage: reacdb \u003c- load_reacList(org=\"R-HSA\")  A very useful query interface for Reactome is the ReactomeContentService4R package. Its vignette provides many useful examples, see here. A sample plot from ReactomeContentService4R is shown below. For metabolite (set) enrichment analysis (MEA/MSEA) users might also be interested in the MetaboAnalystR package that interfaces with the MataboAnalyst web service.\nFigure 1: Fireworks plot depicting genome-wide view of reactome pathways.\n  Functional Enrichment Analysis Methods Over-representation analysis (ORA) GOstats Package The GOstats package allows testing for both over and under representation of GO terms using either the standard Hypergeometric test or a conditional Hypergeometric test that uses the relationships among the GO terms for conditioning (Falcon and Gentleman 2007).\n## Load required packages library(GOstats); library(GO.db); library(org.At.tair.db) ## Define universe and test sample set geneUniverse \u003c- keys(org.At.tairGENENAME) geneSample \u003c- c(\"AT2G46210\", \"AT2G19880\", \"AT2G38910\", \"AT5G25140\", \"AT2G44525\") ## Generate params object params \u003c- new(\"GOHyperGParams\", geneIds = geneSample, universeGeneIds = geneUniverse, annotation=\"org.At.tair\", ontology = \"MF\", pvalueCutoff = 0.5, conditional = FALSE, testDirection = \"over\") ## Run enrichment test hgOver \u003c- hyperGTest(params) ## Viewing of results summary(hgOver)[1:4,] htmlReport(hgOver, file = \"MyhyperGresult.html\") # html file will be written to current working directory  GOHyperGAll and GOCluster_Report The following introduceds a GOCluster_Report convenience function from the systemPipeR package. The first part shows how to generate the proper catdb lookup data structure for any organism supported by BioMart (H Backman and Girke 2016). This more time consuming step needs to be performed only once.\n## Create a custom genome-to-GO lookup table for enrichment testing library(systemPipeR); library(biomaRt) listMarts() # To choose BioMart database listMarts(host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") ## Obtain annotations from BioMart listMarts() # To choose BioMart database m \u003c- useMart(\"plants_mart\", host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") listDatasets(m) m \u003c- useMart(\"plants_mart\", dataset = \"athaliana_eg_gene\", host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") listAttributes(m) # Choose data types you want to download go \u003c- getBM(attributes = c(\"go_id\", \"tair_locus\", \"namespace_1003\"), mart = m) go \u003c- go[go[, 3] != \"\", ]; go[, 3] \u003c- as.character(go[, 3]) go[go[, 3] == \"molecular_function\", 3] \u003c- \"F\"; go[go[, 3] == \"biological_process\", 3] \u003c- \"P\"; go[go[, 3] == \"cellular_component\", 3] \u003c- \"C\" go[1:4, ] dir.create(\"./GO\") write.table(go, \"GO/GOannotationsBiomart_mod.txt\", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\") catdb \u003c- makeCATdb(myfile = \"GO/GOannotationsBiomart_mod.txt\", lib = NULL, org = \"\", colno = c(1, 2, 3), idconv = NULL) save(catdb, file=\"GO/catdb.RData\")  For the actual enrichment analysis one can load the catdb object from the corresponding file, and then perform batch GO term analysis where the results include all terms meeting a user-provided P-value cutoff as well as GO Slim terms.\n## Next time catDB can be loaded from file load(\"GO/catdb.RData\") ## Perform enrichment test on single gene set geneids \u003c- unique(as.character(catmap(catdb)$D_MF[,\"GeneID\"])) gene_set_list \u003c- sapply(c(\"Set1\", \"Set2\", \"Set3\"), function(x) sample(geneids, 100), simplify=FALSE) GOHyperGAll(catdb=catdb, gocat=\"MF\", sample=gene_set_list[[1]], Nannot=2)[1:20,] ## Batch analysis of many gene sets for all and slim terms goall \u003c- GOCluster_Report(catdb=catdb, setlist=gene_set_list, method=\"all\", id_type=\"gene\", CLSZ=2, cutoff=0.01, gocats=c(\"MF\", \"BP\", \"CC\"), recordSpecGO = NULL) ## GO Slim analysis by subsetting enrichment results accordingly m \u003c- useMart(\"plants_mart\", dataset = \"athaliana_eg_gene\", host = \"plants.ensembl.org\") goslimvec \u003c- as.character(getBM(attributes = c(\"goslim_goa_accession\"), mart = m)[, 1]) goslim \u003c- GOCluster_Report(catdb=catdb, setlist=gene_set_list, method=\"slim\",id_type=\"gene\", myslimv=goslimvec, CLSZ=2, cutoff=0.01, gocats = c(\"MF\", \"BP\", \"CC\"), recordSpecGO = NULL) ## Plot 'GOBatchResult' as bar plot goBarplot(goslim, gocat=\"MF\")  Figure 2: Batch ORA result of GO slim terms using 3 test gene sets.\n  Set enrichment analysis (SEA) fgsea Package The fgsea function performs gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on a score ranked gene list (Sergushichev 2016). Compared to other GESA implementations, fgsea is very fast. Its P-value estimation is based on an adaptive multi-level split Monte-Carlo scheme. In addition to its speed, it is very flexible in adopting custom annotation systems since it stores the gene-to-category annotations in a simple list object that is easy to create. The following uses the keegdb and reacdb lists created above as annotation systems.\n## Load packages and create sample ranked gene list library(fgsea); library(data.table); library(ggplot2); library(org.At.tair.db) set.seed(42) ## fgsea with KEGG (Arabidopsis) geneids \u003c- mappedkeys(org.At.tairCHR) exampleRanks \u003c- sort(setNames(sample(seq(-100,100, by=0.001), length(geneids)), geneids)) fgseaResKegg \u003c- fgsea(pathways=keggdb, stats=exampleRanks, minSize=15, maxSize=500) head(fgseaResKegg[order(pval), ]) plotEnrichment(keggdb[[\"ath00052 (00052) - Galactose metabolism\"]], exampleRanks) + labs(title=\"Galactose metabolism\") ## fgsea with Reactome (Human) geneids \u003c- unique(as.character(unlist(reacdb))) exampleRanks \u003c- sort(setNames(sample(seq(-100,100, by=0.001), length(geneids)), geneids)) fgseaResReac \u003c- fgsea(pathways=reacdb, stats=exampleRanks, minSize=15, maxSize=500) head(fgseaResReac[order(pval), ]) plotEnrichment(reacdb[[\"R-HSA-3247509 (R-HSA-3247509) - Chromatin modifying enzymes\"]], exampleRanks) + labs(title=\"Chromatin modifying enzymes\")  The plotEnrichment can be used to create enrichment plots.

Clustering is the classification of data objects into similarity groups (clusters) according to a defined distance measure. It is used in many fields, such as machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, image analysis, genomics, systems biology, etc. Machine learning typically regards data clustering as a form of unsupervised learning.   Why Clustering and Data Mining in R?}  Efficient data structures and functions for clustering Reproducible and programmable Comprehensive set of clustering and machine learning libraries Integration with many other data analysis tools   Useful Links  Cluster Task Views Machine Learning Task Views UCR Manual    Data Preprocessing Data Transformations Choice depends on data set!\n  Center and standardize\n Center: subtract from each value the mean of the corresponding vector Standardize: devide by standard deviation   Result: Mean = 0 and STDEV = 1    Center and scale with the scale() function\n Center: subtract from each value the mean of the corresponding vector Scale: divide centered vector by their root mean square (rms): $$ x_{rms} = \\sqrt[]{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}{^2}}} $$   Result: Mean = 0 and STDEV = 1    Log transformation\n  Rank transformation: replace measured values by ranks\n  No transformation\n  Distance Methods List of most common ones!\n Euclidean distance for two profiles X and Y: $$ d(X,Y) = \\sqrt[]{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i}-y_{i})^2} }$$  Disadvantages: not scale invariant, not for negative correlations   Maximum, Manhattan, Canberra, binary, Minowski, … Correlation-based distance: 1-r  Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC): $$r = \\frac{n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}y_{i}} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_{i}}}{ \\sqrt[]{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}^2} - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i})^2}) (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_{i}^2} - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_{i})^2})} }$$  Disadvantage: outlier sensitive   Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC)  Same calculation as PCC but with ranked values!      There are many more distance measures\n If the distances among items are quantifiable, then clustering is possible. Choose the most accurate and meaningful distance measure for a given field of application. If uncertain then choose several distance measures and compare the results.  Cluster Linkage   Clustering Algorithms Hierarchical Clustering Overview of algorithm  Identify clusters (items) with closest distance Join them to new clusters Compute distance between clusters (items) Return to step 1  Hierarchical clustering: agglomerative Approach   Hierarchical Clustering with Heatmap    A heatmap is a color coded table. To visually identify patterns, the rows and columns of a heatmap are often sorted by hierarchical clustering trees. In case of gene expression data, the row tree usually represents the genes, the column tree the treatments and the colors in the heat table represent the intensities or ratios of the underlying gene expression data set.  Hierarchical Clustering Approaches  Agglomerative approach (bottom-up)  R functions: hclust() and agnes()   Divisive approach (top-down)  R function: diana()    Tree Cutting to Obtain Discrete Clusters  Node height in tree Number of clusters Search tree nodes by distance cutoff  Examples Using hclust and heatmap.2 library(gplots) y \u003c- matrix(rnorm(500), 100, 5, dimnames=list(paste(\"g\", 1:100, sep=\"\"), paste(\"t\", 1:5, sep=\"\"))) heatmap.2(y) # Shortcut to final result  Stepwise Approach with Tree Cutting ## Row- and column-wise clustering hr \u003c- hclust(as.dist(1-cor(t(y), method=\"pearson\")), method=\"complete\") hc \u003c- hclust(as.dist(1-cor(y, method=\"spearman\")), method=\"complete\") ## Tree cutting mycl \u003c- cutree(hr, h=max(hr$height)/1.5); mycolhc \u003c- rainbow(length(unique(mycl)), start=0.1, end=0.9); mycolhc \u003c- mycolhc[as.vector(mycl)] ## Plot heatmap mycol \u003c- colorpanel(40, \"darkblue\", \"yellow\", \"white\") # or try redgreen(75) heatmap.2(y, Rowv=as.dendrogram(hr), Colv=as.dendrogram(hc), col=mycol, scale=\"row\", density.info=\"none\", trace=\"none\", RowSideColors=mycolhc)  K-Means Clustering Overview of algorithm  Choose the number of k clusters Randomly assign items to the k clusters Calculate new centroid for each of the k clusters Calculate the distance of all items to the k centroids Assign items to closest centroid Repeat until clusters assignments are stable    Examples km \u003c- kmeans(t(scale(t(y))), 3) km$cluster  ## g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 g6 g7 g8 g9 g10 g11 g12 g13 g14 g15 g16 g17 g18 g19 g20 ## 1 2 1 3 3 1 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 ## g21 g22 g23 g24 g25 g26 g27 g28 g29 g30 g31 g32 g33 g34 g35 g36 g37 g38 g39 g40 ## 2 1 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 3 1 1 3 3 3 1 3 1 1 3 ## g41 g42 g43 g44 g45 g46 g47 g48 g49 g50 g51 g52 g53 g54 g55 g56 g57 g58 g59 g60 ## 1 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 1 3 1 ## g61 g62 g63 g64 g65 g66 g67 g68 g69 g70 g71 g72 g73 g74 g75 g76 g77 g78 g79 g80 ## 1 1 3 3 2 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 ## g81 g82 g83 g84 g85 g86 g87 g88 g89 g90 g91 g92 g93 g94 g95 g96 g97 g98 g99 g100 ## 3 3 2 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 3 3 3  Fuzzy C-Means Clustering  In contrast to strict (hard) clustering approaches, fuzzy (soft) clustering methods allow multiple cluster memberships of the clustered items (Hathaway, Bezdek, and Pal 1996). This is commonly achieved by assigning to each item a weight of belonging to each cluster. Thus, items at the edge of a cluster, may be in a cluster to a lesser degree than items at the center of a cluster. Typically, each item has as many coefficients (weights) as there are clusters that sum up for each item to one.

With this a similarity coefficient, such as the Jaccard index, can be computed. The latter is defined as the size of the intersect divided by the size of the union of two sample sets: a/(a+b+c). In case of partitioning results, the Jaccard Index measures how frequently pairs of items are joined together in two clustering data sets and how often pairs are observed only in one set. Related coefficient are the Rand Index and the Adjusted Rand Index. These indices also consider the number of pairs (d) that are not joined together in any of the clusters in both sets.  Example: Jaccard index for cluster sets The following imports the cindex() function and computes the Jaccard Index for two sample clusters.\nsource(\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~tgirke/Documents/R_BioCond/My_R_Scripts/clusterIndex.R\") library(cluster); y \u003c- matrix(rnorm(5000), 1000, 5, dimnames=list(paste(\"g\", 1:1000, sep=\"\"), paste(\"t\", 1:5, sep=\"\"))); clarax \u003c- clara(y, 49); clV1 \u003c- clarax$clustering; clarax \u003c- clara(y, 50); clV2 \u003c- clarax$clustering ci \u003c- cindex(clV1=clV1, clV2=clV2, self=FALSE, minSZ=1, method=\"jaccard\") ci[2:3] # Returns Jaccard index and variables used to compute it  ## $variables ## a b c ## 14537 647 807 ## ## $Jaccard_Index ## [1] 0.9090739  Clustering cluster sets with Jaccard index The following example shows how one can cluster entire cluster result sets. First, 10 sample cluster results are created with Clara using k-values from 3 to 12. The results are stored as named clustering vectors in a list object. Then a nested sapply loop is used to generate a similarity matrix of Jaccard Indices for the clustering results. After converting the result into a distance matrix, hierarchical clustering is performed with hclust.}\nclVlist \u003c- lapply(3:12, function(x) clara(y[1:30, ], k=x)$clustering); names(clVlist) \u003c- paste(\"k\", \"=\", 3:12) d \u003c- sapply(names(clVlist), function(x) sapply(names(clVlist), function(y) cindex(clV1=clVlist[[y]], clV2=clVlist[[x]], method=\"jaccard\")[[3]])) hv \u003c- hclust(as.dist(1-d)) plot(as.dendrogram(hv), edgePar=list(col=3, lwd=4), horiz=T, main=\"Similarities of 10 Clara Clustering Results for k: 3-12\")   Remember: there are many additional clustering algorithms.

Shiny is an R-based environment for building interactive web applications for data analysis and exploration (“Shiny - Tutorial,” n.d.). One can create a beautiful web app in Shiny with only knowledge of basic R. Shiny apps can be deployed on local computers or web servers including custom and cloud-based servers (e.g. AWS, GCP, shinyapp.io service). The basic structure of a Shiny app is an app.R script containing the user interface (UI) and server components:\n UI  ui \u003c- fluidPage()  Server as a function  server \u003c- function(input, output, session) {}  Statement to define the whole shiny app  shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)  Get started The following introduces the basic development routines for Shiny apps using RStudio. Most other\nR IDEs can be used here as well. For beginners the interactive test and debugging functionalities of RStudio simplify the development process of Shiny apps.\nTo start, open an Rscript in Rstudio and load the shiny library\nlibrary(shiny)  When typing shiny in the code editor, the code/function suggestion dialog allows to select the corresponding code snippet. If the dialog does not show up automatically, one can press Ctrl + space to open it (on Mac use command instead of Ctrl).\nAfter selecting shinyapp in the dialog, the following code snippet will be inserted in the code editor.\nlibrary(shiny) ui \u003c- fluidPage( ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) { } shinyApp(ui, server)  This is the basic structure of a Shiny app. Now, save it (Ctrl/Cmd + s) to your current working directory and name it “app.R.” You should see the script file has been recognized as a Shiny app file and it is runnable with a green Run App button on the top-right corner of the script file.\nIf you run current app, it should open up a tab in the browser or open the Viewer in Rstudio of the app. You can change where to open it with the down-arrow button next to the Run App button. Current app will give you an empty app because we have not filled it with any components.\nAdd UI Basic layout UI is the skeleton of the app. In Shiny, UI is usually defined by a page structure by calling the one of the page function, like a fluidPage, fixedPage, etc. Then, you can start to fill components within this structure. It is similar as writing HTML with R wrappers. It will be no problem if you do not know what is HTML, remember some of the following tags (functions) will be enough.\n h1-h6: Level 1 to level 6 headings, similar as # … ###### in Rmarkdown p (paragraph): basic text container fluidRow: create a row in the app (horizontal space) to hold children components column: divide a vertical space in the app. The width is 1-12. This relates to the HTML framework Bootstrap that Shiny is built on. You can divide the parent container vertically from 1-12, 1 is the minimum width and 12 is max. a: create a link img: add an image code: code blocks  Let us try to put things above to create an app:\nlibrary(shiny) ui \u003c- fluidPage( h1(\"My biggest title\"), column( width = 6, h2(\"section 1\"), p(\"some text blablablablablablablablablablablablablabla\"), fluidRow( column( 6, h4(\"sub section 1\"), p(\"some text blablablablablablablablablablablablablabla\"), code(\"1 + 1 = 2; mean(1, 2, 3)\") ), column( 6, h4(\"sub section 2\"), p(\"some text blablablablablablablablablablablablablabla\"), a(href = \"https://google.com\", \"Link to Google\") ) ) ), column( width = 6, h2(\"section 2\"), p(\"some text blablablablablablablablablablablablablabla\"), p(\"some other text blablablablablablablablablablablablablabla\"), img(src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeR.github.io/main/static/images/systemPipeR.png\", style = \"height: 280px\") ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) {} shinyApp(ui, server)  High-level layout functions There are some high-level functions in Shiny to help you create these layout easily:\n titlePanel, splitLayout, verticalLayout, sidebarLayout, tabsetPanel and more. Read more on Shiny reference manual.  Sidebar layout:\nui \u003c- fluidPage( titlePanel(\"Hello Shiny!\"), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( h3(\"Side bar content\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\") ), mainPanel( h3(\"Main panel content\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\") ) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) {} shinyApp(ui, server)  Tabset layout:\nui \u003c- fluidPage( tabsetPanel( tabPanel(\"panel1\", p(\"Panel 1 content\")), tabPanel(\"panel2\", p(\"Panel 2 content\")), tabPanel(\"panel3\", p(\"Panel 3 content\")) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) {} shinyApp(ui, server)  Interactive components The most important part that makes a Shiny app different from a static website is the interactivity. User interactions are achieved with interactive components (widgets) on the UI side. These components inlcude but not limited to, buttons, text inputs, select inputs, check boxes, numeric inputs, dates and more. Read more of these components on Shiny website.\nHere we demonstrate some of these components in addition to the sidebar layout.\nui \u003c- fluidPage( titlePanel(\"Shiny inputs\"), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( h3(\"Some input examples\"), actionButton(inputId = \"btn\", label = \"A button\", icon = icon(\"dna\")), selectInput( inputId = \"select\", label = \"Select input\", choices = c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\") ), sliderInput( inputId = \"slider\", label = \"Slider input\", min = 0, max = 100, value = 0 ), textInput( inputId = \"text\", label = \"Text input\", placeholder = \"Type some text\" ) ), mainPanel( h3(\"Main panel content\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\"), p(\"...\") ) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) {} shinyApp(ui, server)  Server So far we have learned how to create the Shiny UI and add some interactive components to it, but when we interact with these components, nothing will happen because we have not added any backend logic to tell the app what will happen when these components are interacted (clicked, selected, changed …). Here, the server comes in for the role. We define most interactive logic in the server (much of the logic can be done with Javascript too, but that is advanced, not be discussed here).\nServer function In Shiny, UI is defined as a list-like R object, but server is different, it is a function. From the different object type you would know UI is evaluated before app runs and done. Server is waiting to be evaluated after app run. It is subjected to accept different function inputs and to be re-evaluated many times.\nThree important arguments of the server function:\n input: list-like object with all user inputs from the UI (get value from UI) output: list-like object with data sending to the browser (set value to UI) session: R6-like class, containing all information of current app session (advanced use only).  Reactivity The entire Shiny server is built on a concept called reactivity. It defines how reactive source, usually UI interaction (button clicking) to trigger some server expressions to be evaluated and finally result some updates to the reactive endpoint, usually like sending data to the UI, making a new plot.\nWatch reactivity change Reactivity objects in Shiny (change of this object will trigger shiny to do the recalculation):\n input: each individual input object, like input$id1, input$id2, input$id3 reactive: expressions defined in reactive({...}) reactiveVal: a single object that will be changed at some point. reactiveValues: a list of objects that will be changed at some point.  There are a few different ways to watch for Shiny reactivity.\n  observe: this observer triggers if any reactive expression in is changed\nobserve({ input$btn1 input$btn2 # do some thing })  Both clicking on button 1 and button 2 will trigger this expression.\n  observeEvent: this observer triggers if any reactive expression in is changed\nobserveEvent(eventExpr = input$btn1, { input$btn2 # do some thing })  Only clicking on button 1 but not button 2 will trigger this expression.\n  reactive: all reactive expressions inside will trigger this reactive expression to be redefined. It is triggered similar to observe but will return a value to be used in other reactive expressions.\nmy_react \u003c- reactive({ input$btn1 input$btn2 # do some thing # return the final value })  Both clicking on button 1 and button 2 will trigger this expression.\n  All shiny render events: all reactive expressions inside shiny render events like renderPlot, renderText, … will trigger the rendering to be recalcualted. to be used in other reactive expressions.\noutput$myplot \u003c- renderPlot({ input$btn1 input$btn2 plot(1, 2) })  Both clicking on button 1 and button 2 will trigger this expression.\n  Use input to get values Here we use the sidebarLayout example and add some server code to demo how to get values from user interactions. Run this example and watch the output in your R console.\nlibrary(shiny) ui \u003c- fluidPage( titlePanel(\"Shiny inputs\"), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( h3(\"Some input examples\"), actionButton(inputId = \"btn\", label = \"A button\", icon = icon(\"dna\")), selectInput( inputId = \"select\", label = \"Select input\", choices = c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\") ), sliderInput( inputId = \"slider\", label = \"Slider input\", min = 0, max = 100, value = 0 ), textInput( inputId = \"text\", label = \"Text input\", placeholder = \"Type some text\" ) ), mainPanel( h3(\"Main panel content\") ) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) { observe({ cat(\"*****observe*****\\n\") cat(\"Button clicked\", input$btn, \"times\\n\") cat(\"Selected value is\", input$select, \"\\n\") cat(\"Slider value is\", input$slider, \"\\n\") cat(\"Typed balue is\", input$text, \"\\n\") }) # or use observeEvent, watch closely the difference of when the text will be printed on console # observeEvent(input$select, { # cat(\"*****observeEvent*****\\n\") # cat(\"Button clicked\", input$btn, \"times\\n\") # cat(\"Selected value is\", input$select, \"\\n\") # cat(\"Slider value is\", input$slider, \"\\n\") # cat(\"Typed balue is\", input$text, \"\\n\") # }) } shinyApp(ui, server)  Use output to update UI Instead of print the text to R console, we can use output to send text to users. Here we use output$text_out \u003c- renderPrint({...}) on server to create the expression. Also we need to add verbatimTextOutput(outputId = \"text_out\") inside mainPanel to indicate where we want to display the text on UI.\nIn shiny all render functions renderXxx are coupled with a xxxOutput function as container on UI. Read more of them on Shiny website.\nlibrary(shiny) ui \u003c- fluidPage( titlePanel(\"Shiny inputs\"), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( h3(\"Some input examples\"), actionButton(inputId = \"btn\", label = \"A button\", icon = icon(\"dna\")), selectInput( inputId = \"select\", label = \"Select input\", choices = c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\") ), sliderInput( inputId = \"slider\", label = \"Slider input\", min = 0, max = 100, value = 0 ), textInput( inputId = \"text\", label = \"Text input\", placeholder = \"Type some text\" ) ), mainPanel( h3(\"Main panel content\"), verbatimTextOutput(outputId = \"text_out\") ) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) { output$text_out \u003c- renderPrint({ cat(\"*****observe*****\\n\") cat(\"Button clicked\", input$btn, \"times\\n\") cat(\"Selected value is\", input$select, \"\\n\") cat(\"Slider value is\", input$slider, \"\\n\") cat(\"Typed balue is\", input$text, \"\\n\") }) } shinyApp(ui, server)  Example 2: create an interactive plot\nlibrary(shiny) library(ggplot2) ui \u003c- fluidPage( titlePanel(\"Plot control\"), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( h3(\"Some input examples\"), selectInput( inputId = \"select_col\", label = \"Choose a column\", choices = names(iris)[-length(names(iris))] # exlcude last column ), selectInput( inputId = \"select_fill\", label = \"Choose a fill color\", choices = c(\"white\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"orange\", \"yellow\") ), textInput( inputId = \"text\", label = \"Plot title\", value = \"Box plot of iris\" ) ), mainPanel( h3(\"Box plot of iris\"), plotOutput(\"myplot\") ) ) ) server \u003c- function(input, output, session) { output$myplot \u003c- renderPlot({ ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes_string(y = input$select_col), fill = input$select_fill) + ggtitle(paste0(input$text, \"-\", input$select_col)) }) } shinyApp(ui, server)  More examples There are many other basic examples that are provided by this package and have a taste what we can do with Shiny apps.\nTo list app examples\nrunExample()  ## Valid examples are \"01_hello\", \"02_text\", \"03_reactivity\", \"04_mpg\", \"05_sliders\", \"06_tabsets\", \"07_widgets\", \"08_html\", \"09_upload\", \"10_download\", \"11_timer\"  Choose one of the examples you would like, e.g.\nrunExample(\"01_hello\")  You can see it breaks into two section, left-side is the actual app, on the right-side is the code to build this app. When we build Shiny apps, The right-side section is usually not displayed. It is called the “showcase” mode which is good for teaching. When you interact with app, this mode will also highlight what part of the code has been re-evaluated by your interaction in order to update the UI, a powerful utility to learn how shiny backend work.\nHowever, to have a feel what a normal app would look like, use display.mode=\"normal\"\nrunExample(\"01_hello\", display.mode=\"normal\")  The following Shiny app is hosted on shinyapps.io and embedded into the markdown (or html) source of this page using the following iframe syntax:\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/diamonds/\" style=\"border: none; width: 880px; height: 900px\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e   Deploy This can be done on local or cloud systems. An easy solution is to get an account on shinyapps.io and then deploy Shiny apps there. Read the tutorial on Shiny website.\nCreate a Shiny app for your final project After we have familiarized with Shiny basics, we can try to create a Shiny app to to course project. Here is a template app file, source code stored in this Github repository.\nThis template helps readers to visualize your downstream results of workflows.\n A barplot of deferentially expressed genes (DEG) across different comparison groups from the RNAseq workflow. A barplot to show different gene ontology (GO) enriched results. This plot can be applied to both RNAseq and ChIPseq projects. Add you own additional plots.  The embedded app is below or to have a better visual, open it in a new tab with this link: https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/gen242_shiny_template/\n To use this template on your own dataset:\n  click the “Use this template” on the Github page to create your own repository.\n  Clone this newly generated repository to your local computer.\n  Install all packages that are required by the template:\ninstall.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"DT\", \"ggplot2\", \"plotly\", \"dplyr\"))    Do not modify anything of the template at this point.

The instructions for the second appoach are more detailed since it is likely to provide the most practical solution for newer users of R.\n1. R Base Approach R packages can be built with the package.skeleton function. The most comprehensive documentation on package development is provided by the Writing R Extensions page on CRAN. The basic workflow example below will create a directory named mypackage containing the skeleton of the package for all functions, methods and classes defined in the R script(s) passed on to the code_files argument. The basic structure of the package directory is described here. The package directory will also contain a file named Read-and-delete-me with instructions for completing the package:\n1.1 Create package skeleton ## Download R script (here pkg_build_fct.R) containing two sample functions download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242/main/content/en/tutorials/rpackages/helper_functions/pkg_build_fct.R\", \"pkg_build_fct.R\") ## Build package skeleton based on functions in pkg_build_fct.R package.skeleton(name=\"mypackage\", code_files=c(\"pkg_build_fct.R\"))  The given example will create a directory named mypackage containing the skeleton of the package for all functions, methods and classes defined in the R script(s) passed on to the code_files argument. The basic structure of the package directory is described here. The package directory will also contain a file named ‘Read-and-delete-me’ with the following instructions for completing the package:\n Edit the help file skeletons in man, possibly combining help files for multiple functions. Edit the exports in NAMESPACE, and add necessary imports. Put any C/C++/Fortran code in src. If you have compiled code, add a useDynLib() directive to NAMESPACE. Run R CMD build to build the package tarball. Run R CMD check to check the package tarball. Read Writing R Extensions for more information.  1.2 Build package Once a package skeleton is available one can build the package from the command-line (Linux/OS X), or from within R by executing the command-line calls with R’s system(\"...\") command. For instance, the command-line call R CMD build ... can be run from within R with system(\"R CMD build ...\"). The following examples refer to the R console.\nsystem(\"R CMD build mypackage\")  1.3 Check package This will create a tarball of the package with its version number encoded in the file name (here mypackage_1.0.tar.gz). Subsequently, the package tarball needs to be checked for errors with R CMD check.\nsystem(\"R CMD check mypackage_1.0.tar.gz\")  All issues in a package’s source code and documentation should be addressed until R CMD check returns no error or warning messages anymore.\n1.4 Install package Install package from source on Linux or OS X systems.\ninstall.packages(\"mypackage_1.0.tar.gz\", repos=NULL) # On OS X include the argument type=\"source\"  Windows requires a zip archive for installing R packages, which can be most conveniently created from the command-line (Linux/OS X) by installing the package in a local directory (here tempdir) and then creating a zip archive from the installed package directory:\n$ mkdir tempdir $ R CMD INSTALL -l tempdir mypackage_1.0.tar.gz $ cd tempdir $ zip -r mypackage mypackage ## The resulting mypackage.zip archive can be installed from R under Windows like this: install.packages(\"mypackage.zip\", repos=NULL)  This procedure only works for packages which do not rely on compiled code (C/C++). Instructions to fully build an R package under Windows can be found here and here.\n1.5 Maintain package Several useful helper utilities exist for maintaing and extending packages. Typical package development routines include:\n Adding new functions, methods and classes to the script files in the ./R directory in your package Adding their names to the NAMESPACE file of the package Additional .Rd help templates can be generated with the prompt() function family like this:  source(\"myscript.R\") # imports functions, methods and classes from myscript.R prompt(myfct) # writes help file myfct.Rd promptClass(\"myclass\") # writes file myclass-class.Rd promptMethods(\"mymeth\") # writes help file mymeth.Rd  The resulting .Rd help files can be edited in a text editor, and properly rendered and viewed from within R with help of the following functions.\nlibrary(tools) Rd2txt(\"./mypackage/man/myfct.Rd\") # renders *.Rd files as they look in final help pages checkRd(\"./mypackage/man/myfct.Rd\") # checks *.Rd help file for problems  1.6 Submit package to public repository The best way of sharing an R package with the community is to submit it to one of the main R package repositories, such as CRAN or Bioconductor. The details about the submission process are given on the corresponding repository submission pages:\n Submitting to Bioconductor Submitting to CRAN  2. R devtools Approach Several package develpment routines of the traditional method outlined above are manual, such as updating the NAMESPACE file and documenting functions in separate help (*.Rd) files. This process can be simplified and partially automated by taking advantage of a more recent R package development environment composed of several helper packages including devtools, usethis, roxygen2 and sinew (Wickham and Bryan, n.d.). Many books and web sites document this process in more detail. Here is a small selection of useful online documentation about R package development:\n Book: R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan My First R Package by Fong Chun Chan How to Creat an R Package, Easy Mode by Amit Kohli Package Development Cheat Sheet Automating roxygen2 documentation with sinew by Jonathan Sidi: Blog and CRAN  Workflow for building R packages The following outlines the basic workflow for building, testing and extending R packages with the package development environment functionalities outlined above.\n2.1 Create package skeleton library(\"devtools\"); library(\"roxygen2\"); library(\"usethis\"); library(sinew) # If not availble install these packages with 'install.packages(...)' create(\"myfirstpkg\") # Creates package skeleton. The chosen name (here myfirstpkg) will be the name of the package. setwd(\"myfirstpkg\") # Set working directory of R session to package directory 'myfirstpkg' use_mit_license() # Add license information to description file (here MIT). To look up alternatives, do ?use_mit_license  2.2 Add R functions Next, R functions can be added to *.R file(s) under the R directory of the new package. Several functions can be organized in one *.R file, each in its own file or any combination. For demonstration purposes, the following will download an R file (pkg_build_fct.R from here) defining two functions (named:myMAcomp and talkToMe) and save it to the R directory of the package.\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242/main/content/en/tutorials/rpackages/helper_functions/pkg_build_fct.R\", \"R/pkg_build_fct.R\")  2.3 Auto-generate roxygen comment lines The makeOxygen function from the sinew package creates roxygen2 comment skeletons based on the information from each function (below for myMAcomp example). The roxygen comment lines need to be added above the code of each function. This can be done by copy and paste from the R console or by writing the output to a temporary file (below via writeLines). Alternatively, the makeOxyFile function can be used to create a roxygenized copy of an R source file, where the roxygen comment lines have been added above all functions automatically. Next, the default text in the comment lines needs to be replaced by meaningful text describing the utility and usage of each function. This editing process of documentation can be completed and/or revised any time.\nload_all() # Loads package in a simulated way without installing it. writeLines(makeOxygen(myMAcomp), \"myroxylines\") # This creates a 'myroxylines' file in current directory. Delete this file after adding its content to the corresponding functions.  2.4 Autogenerate help files The document function autogenerates for each function one *.Rd file in the man directory of the package. The content in the *.Rd help files is based on the information in the roxygen comment lines generated in the previous step. In addition, all relevant export/import instructions are added to the NAMESPACE file. Importantly, when using roxygen-based documentation in a package then the NAMESPACE and *.Rd files should not be manually edited since this information will be lost during the automation routines provided by roxygen2.\ndocument() # Auto-generates/updates *.Rd files under man directory (here: myMAcomp.Rd and talkToMe.Rd) tools::Rd2txt(\"man/myMAcomp.Rd\") # Renders Rd file from source tools::checkRd(\"man/myMAcomp.Rd\") # Checks Rd file for problems  2.5 Add a vignette A vignette template can be auto-generated with the use_vignette function from the usethis package. The *.Rmd source file of the vignette will be located under a new vignette directory. Additional vignettes can be manually added to this directory as needed.\nuse_vignette(\"introduction\", title=\"Introduction to this package\")  2.6 Check, install and build package Now the package can be checked for problems. All warnings and errors should be addressed prior to submission to a public repository. After this it can be installed on a user’s system with the install command. In addition, the build function allows to assemble the package in a *.tar.gz file. The latter is often important for sharing packages and/or submitting them to public repositories.\nsetwd(\"..\") # Redirect R session to parent directory check(\"myfirstpkg\") # Check package for problems, when in pkg dir one can just use check() # remove.packages(\"myfirstpkg\") # Optional. Removes test package if already installed install(\"myfirstpkg\", build_vignettes=TRUE) # Installs package build(\"myfirstpkg\") # Creates *.tar.gz file for package required to for submission to CRAN/Bioc  2.7 Using the new package After installing and loading the package its functions, help files and vignettes can be accessed as follows.\nlibrary(\"myfirstpkg\") library(help=\"myfirstpkg\") ?myMAcomp vignette(\"introduction\", \"myfirstpkg\")  Another very useful development function is test for evaluating the test code of a package.\n2.8 Share package on GitHub To host and share the new package myfirstpkg on GitHub, one can use the following steps:\n Create an empty target GitHub repos online (e.g. named mypkg_repos) as outlined here. Clone the new GitHub repos to local system with git clone https://github.com/\u003cgithub_username\u003e/\u003crepo name\u003e (here from command-line) Copy the root directory of the package into the downloaded repos with cp -r myfirstpkg mypkg_repos Next cd into mypkg_repos, and then add all files and directories of the package to the staging area with git add -A :/. Commit and push the changes to GitHub with: git commit -am \"first commit\"; git push. After this the package should be life on the corresponding GitHub web page. Assuming the package is public, it can be installed directly from GitHub by anyone as shown below (from within R). Installs of private packages require a personal access token (PAT) that needs to be assigned to the auth_token argument. PATs can be created here.  devtools::install_github(\"\u003cgithub_user_name\u003e/\u003cmypkg_repos\u003e\", subdir=\"myfirstpkg\") # If the package is in the root directory of the repos, then the 'subdir' argument can be dropped.

This way one can pipe together multiple operations by writing them from left-to-right or top-to-bottom.

Using this community standard in systemPipeR has many advantages. For instance, the integration of CWL allows running systemPipeR workflows from a single specification instance either entirely from within R, from various command line wrappers (e.g., cwl-runner) or from other languages (, e.g., Bash or Python). systemPipeR includes support for both command line and R/Bioconductor software as well as resources for containerization, parallel evaluations on computer clusters along with the automated generation of interactive analysis reports.\nAn important feature of systemPipeR's CWL interface is that it provides two options to run command line tools and workflows based on CWL. First, one can run CWL in its native way via an R-based wrapper utility for cwl-runner or cwl-tools (CWL-based approach). Second, one can run workflows using CWL’s command line and workflow instructions from within R (R-based approach). In the latter case the same CWL workflow definition files (e.g. .cwl and .yml) are used but rendered and executed entirely with R functions defined by systemPipeR, and thus use CWL mainly as a command line and workflow definition format rather than software to run workflows. In this regard systemPipeR also provides several convenience functions that are useful for designing and debugging workflows, such as a command line rendering function to retrieve the exact command line strings for each data set and processing step prior to running a command line.\nThis overview introduces how CWL describes command line tools and how to connect them to create workflows. In addition, we will demonstrate how the workflow can be easily scalable with systemPipeR.\nLoad package Important: this tutorial uses several new functions that are currently only available in the development version of the systemPipeR package that is installed under R-4.0.3 and R-4.1.0 on the HPCC cluster at UCR.\nCWL command line specifications CWL command line specifications are written in YAML format.\nIn CWL, files with the extension .cwl define the parameters of a chosen command line step or workflow, while files with the extension .yml define the input variables of command line steps.\nLet’s explore the .cwl file:\ndir_path \u003c- system.file(\"extdata/cwl/example/\", package=\"systemPipeR\") cwl \u003c- yaml::read_yaml(file.path(dir_path, \"example.cwl\"))   The cwlVersion component shows the CWL specification version used by the document. The class component shows this document describes a command line tool. Note that CWL has another class, called Workflow which represents a union of one or more command line tools together.  cwl[1:2]  ## $cwlVersion ## [1] \"v1.0\" ## ## $class ## [1] \"CommandLineTool\"   baseCommand component provides the name of the software that we desire to execute.  cwl[3]  ## $baseCommand ## [1] \"echo\"   The inputs section provides the input information to run the tool. Important components of this section are:  id: each input has an id describing the input name; type: describe the type of input value (string, int, long, float, double, File, Directory or Any); inputBinding: It is optional. This component indicates if the input parameter should appear on the command line. If this component is missing when describing an input parameter, it will not appear in the command line but can be used to build the command line.    cwl[4]  ## $inputs ## $inputs$message ## $inputs$message$type ## [1] \"string\" ## ## $inputs$message$inputBinding ## $inputs$message$inputBinding$position ## [1] 1 ## ## ## ## $inputs$SampleName ## $inputs$SampleName$type ## [1] \"string\" ## ## ## $inputs$results_path ## $inputs$results_path$type ## [1] \"Directory\"   The outputs section should provide a list of the expected outputs after running the command line tools. Important components of this section are:  id: each input has an id describing the output name; type: describe the type of output value (string, int, long, float, double, File, Directory, Any or stdout); outputBinding: This component defines how to set the outputs values. The glob component will define the name of the output value.    cwl[5]  ## $outputs ## $outputs$string ## $outputs$string$type ## [1] \"stdout\"   stdout: component to specify a filename to capture standard output. Note here we are using a syntax that takes advantage of the inputs section, using results_path parameter and also the SampleName to construct the output filename.  cwl[6]  ## $stdout ## [1] \"$(inputs.results_path.basename)/$(inputs.SampleName).txt\"  Next, let’s explore the .yml file, which provide the parameter values for all the components we describe above.\nFor this simple example, we have three parameters defined:\nyaml::read_yaml(file.path(dir_path, \"example_single.yml\"))  ## $message ## [1] \"Hello World!\" ## ## $SampleName ## [1] \"M1\" ## ## $results_path ## $results_path$class ## [1] \"Directory\" ## ## $results_path$path ## [1] \"./results\"  Note that if we define an input component in the .cwl file, this value needs to be also defined here in the .yml file.\nHow to connect CWL description files within systemPipeR SYSargs2 container stores all the information and instructions needed for processing a set of input files with a single or many command-line steps within a workflow (i.e. several components of the software or several independent software tools). The SYSargs2 object is created and fully populated with loadWF and `renderWF`` construct functions.\nThe following imports a .cwl file (here example.cwl) for running the echo Hello World example.\nHW \u003c- loadWF( wf_file=\"example.cwl\", input_file=\"example_single.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) HW \u003c- renderWF(HW) HW  ## Instance of 'SYSargs2': ## Slot names/accessors: ## targets: 0 (...), targetsheader: 0 (lines) ## modules: 0 ## wf: 0, clt: 1, yamlinput: 3 (components) ## input: 1, output: 1 ## cmdlist: 1 ## WF Steps: ## 1. example (rendered: TRUE)  cmdlist(HW)  ## $defaultid ## $defaultid$example ## [1] \"echo Hello World! \u003e results/M1.txt\"  However, we are limited to run just one command line or one sample in this example. To scale the command line over many samples, a simple solution offered by systemPipeR is to provide a variable for each of the parameters that we want to run with multiple samples.\nLet’s explore the example:\nyml \u003c- yaml::read_yaml(file.path(dir_path, \"example.yml\")) yml  ## $message ## [1] \"_STRING_\" ## ## $SampleName ## [1] \"_SAMPLE_\" ## ## $results_path ## $results_path$class ## [1] \"Directory\" ## ## $results_path$path ## [1] \"./results\"  For the message and SampleName parameter, we are passing a variable connecting with a third file called targets.\nNow, let’s explore the targets file structure:\ntargetspath \u003c- system.file(\"extdata/cwl/example/targets_example.txt\", package=\"systemPipeR\") read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = \"#\")  ## Message SampleName ## 1 Hello World! M1 ## 2 Hello USA! M2 ## 3 Hello Bioconcudctor! M3  The targets file defines all input files or values and sample ids of an analysis workflow. For this example, we have defined a string message for the echo command line tool, in the first column that will be evaluated, and the second column is the SampleName id for each one of the messages. Any number of additional columns can be added as needed.\nUsers should note here, the usage of targets files is optional when using systemPipeR's new CWL interface. Since for organizing experimental variables targets files are extremely useful and user-friendly. Thus, we encourage users to keep using them.\nHow to connect the parameter files and targets file information? The constructor functions create an SYSargs2 S4 class object connecting three input files:\n- CWL command line specification file (`wf_file` argument); - Input variables (`input_file` argument); - Targets file (`targets` argument).  As demonstrated above, the latter is optional for workflow steps lacking input files. The connection between input variables (here defined by input_file argument) and the targets file are defined under the inputvars argument. A named vector is required, where each element name needs to match with column names in the targets file, and the value must match the names of the .yml variables. This is used to replace the CWL variable and construct all the command-line for that particular step.\nThe variable pattern _XXXX_ is used to distinguish CWL variables that target columns will replace. This pattern is recommended for consistency and easy identification but not enforced.\nThe following imports a .cwl file (same example demonstrated above) for running the echo Hello World example. However, now we are connecting the variable defined on the .yml file with the targets file inputs.\nHW_mul \u003c- loadWorkflow(targets = targetspath, wf_file=\"example.cwl\", input_file=\"example.yml\", dir_path = dir_path) HW_mul \u003c- renderWF(HW_mul, inputvars = c(Message = \"_STRING_\", SampleName = \"_SAMPLE_\")) HW_mul  ## Instance of 'SYSargs2': ## Slot names/accessors: ## targets: 3 (M1...M3), targetsheader: 1 (lines) ## modules: 0 ## wf: 0, clt: 1, yamlinput: 3 (components) ## input: 3, output: 3 ## cmdlist: 3 ## WF Steps: ## 1. example (rendered: TRUE)  cmdlist(HW_mul)  ## $M1 ## $M1$example ## [1] \"echo Hello World! \u003e results/M1.txt\" ## ## ## $M2 ## $M2$example ## [1] \"echo Hello USA! \u003e results/M2.txt\" ## ## ## $M3 ## $M3$example ## [1] \"echo Hello Bioconcudctor! \u003e results/M3.txt\"     Figure 1: Connectivity between CWL param files and targets files.  Creating the CWL param files from the command line Users need to define the command line in a pseudo-bash script format:\ncommand \u003c- \" hisat2 \\ -S \u003cF, out: ./results/M1A.sam\u003e \\ -x \u003cF: ./data/tair10.fasta\u003e \\ -k \u003cint: 1\u003e \\ -min-intronlen \u003cint: 30\u003e \\ -max-intronlen \u003cint: 3000\u003e \\ -threads \u003cint: 4\u003e \\ -U \u003cF: ./data/SRR446027_1.fastq.gz\u003e \"  Define prefix and defaults   First line is the base command. Each line is an argument with its default value.\n  For argument lines (starting from the second line), any word before the first space with leading - or -- in each will be treated as a prefix, like -S or --min. Any line without this first word will be treated as no prefix.\n  All defaults are placed inside \u003c...\u003e.\n  First argument is the input argument type. F for “File,” “int,” “string” are unchanged.\n  Optional: use the keyword out followed the type with a , comma separation to indicate if this argument is also an CWL output.\n  Then, use : to separate keywords and default values, any non-space value after the : will be treated as the default value.\n  If any argument has no default value, just a flag, like --verbose, there is no need to add any \u003c...\u003e\n  createParamFiles Function createParamFiles function requires the string as defined above as an input.\nFirst of all, the function will print the three components of the cwl file:\n BaseCommand: Specifies the program to execute. Inputs: Defines the input parameters of the process. Outputs: Defines the parameters representing the output of the process.  The four component is the original command line.\nIf in interactive mode, the function will verify that everything is correct and will ask you to proceed. Here, the user can answer “no” and provide more information at the string level. Another question is to save the param created here.\nIf running the workflow in non-interactive mode, the createParamFiles function will consider “yes” and returning the container.\ncmd \u003c- createParamFiles(command, writeParamFiles = FALSE)  ##

Object Subsetting, Import and Export  Task 1: Sort the rows of the iris data frame by its first column and sort its columns alphabetically by column names. Task 2: Subset the first 12 rows, export the result to a text file and view it in a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets. Task 3: Change some column titles in your spreadsheet program, save the result to a tab delimited text file and import it back into R. Note, for this task you only want to include the read.table command in the homework result (here R script).  Before you start it can be helpful to evaluate the structure of the iris data set with the following commands:\nclass(iris) dim(iris) colnames(iris)  B. Scatter Plots  Task 1: Generate a scatter plot for the first two columns of the iris data frame and color the dots by the Species column. Task 2: Use the xlim/ylim arguments to set limits on the x- and y-axes so that all data points are restricted to the bottom left quadrant of the plot.  Again before you start, evaluate the structure of iris data set. The following commands are useful:\niris[1:4,] table(iris$Species)  C. Bar Plots  Task 1: Calculate the mean values for the Species components of the first four columns in the iris data frame. Organize the results in a matrix where the row names are the unique values from the iris Species column and the column names are the names of the first four iris columns. Task 2: Generate two bar plots for the matrix generated in the previous step: one with stacked bars and one with horizontally arranged bars.  D-H.

Choice of Sequence Type Task 1: Which sequence type - amino acid or nucleotide - is more appropriate to search databases for remotely related sequences? Provide at least three reasons for your decision.\nAnswer: When coding sequences are expected to have weak similarities then one should use protein sequences rather than DNA sequences for database searching, because of (1) their higher information content (20 versus 4 letter alphabet), as well as (2) the better scoring and (3) functional classification systems available for amino acids.\nB.

Different Substitution Matrices Task 1: Load the Biostrings package in R, import the following two cytochrome P450 sequences O15528 and P98187 from NCBI (save as myseq.fasta), and create a global alignment with the pairwiseAlignment function from Biostrings as follows.\nlibrary(Biostrings) myseq \u003c- readAAStringSet(\"myseq.fasta\", \"fasta\") (p \u003c- pairwiseAlignment(myseq[[1]], myseq[[2]], type=\"global\", substitutionMatrix=\"BLOSUM50\")) writePairwiseAlignments(p)  Your answers should address the following items:\nRecord the scores for the scoring matrices BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM80. How and why do the scores differ for the three scoring matrices?\nAnswer 1: The scores for the three BLOSUM substitutions matrices are:\n BLOSUM50: 227 BLOSUM62: 54 BLOSUM80: -52  Answer 2: Since the two sequences are relatively dissimilar (as determined by alignment view from writePairwiseAlignments(p)) it is expected that the BLOSUM matrices trained on more dissimilar sequences (e.g. BLOSUM50) result in higher scores than those trained on less similar sequences (e.g. BLOSUM80).\nSession Info sessionInfo()  ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.8.0 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.8.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats4 parallel stats graphics grDevices utils datasets ## [8] methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] kableExtra_1.3.4 Biostrings_2.58.0 XVector_0.30.0 ## [4] IRanges_2.24.0 S4Vectors_0.28.0 BiocGenerics_0.36.0 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bslib_0.2.4 compiler_4.0.5 jquerylib_0.1.3 tools_4.0.5 ## [5] zlibbioc_1.36.0 digest_0.6.27 viridisLite_0.3.0 jsonlite_1.7.1 ## [9] evaluate_0.14 lifecycle_0.2.0 rlang_0.4.8 rstudioapi_0.13 ## [13] yaml_2.2.1 blogdown_1.2 xfun_0.22 stringr_1.4.0 ## [17] httr_1.4.2 knitr_1.30 xml2_1.3.2 sass_0.3.1 ## [21] systemfonts_1.0.1 webshot_0.5.2 svglite_2.0.0 glue_1.4.2 ## [25] R6_2.5.0 rmarkdown_2.7 bookdown_0.21 magrittr_2.0.1 ## [29] scales_1.1.1 htmltools_0.5.1.1 rvest_0.3.6 colorspace_2.0-0 ## [33] stringi_1.5.3 munsell_0.5.0 crayon_1.3.4  References Needleman, S B, and C D Wunsch. 1970. “A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequence of two proteins.” J.

Unstranded and strand-specific read counting   Task 1: Rerun the RNA-Seq workflow with the toy data sets up to the read quantification step here. Note, the toy data set gets automatically loaded when intializing a workflow environment (directory structure) with the genWorkenvir function (see tutorial here). In the read quantification step with summarizeOverlaps generate count tables for exons by genes (eByg) of the following three strand modes:\n Unstranded Strand-specific for positive (sense) strand Strand-specific for negative (antisense) strand  The solution for generating the unstranded read counts is given below. Note, the upstream steps of the RNA-Seq workflow only need to be rerun to generate the proper inputs for the read counting. Thus, they are not required to be included in the homework results (see HW7.R below).\n  summarizeOverlaps(eByg, bfl, mode=\"Union\", ignore.strand=TRUE, # preprocess.reads=invertStrand, inter.feature=FALSE, singleEnd=TRUE)  Before attempting to solve this homework task please read the vignette Counting reads with summarizeOverlaps (here) from the GenomicAlignments package that defines the summarizeOverlap function. In addition, the help file for ?summarizeOverlaps provides useful information.\n  Task 2: Provide R code that demonstrates that the two strand-specific count tables sum up to the values of the unstranded count table.\n  Task 3: Explain the utility (biological relevance) of the different strand counting modes used under Task 1. Include your explanation as comment text in your homework script (see HW7.R below).\n  Note, for Tasks 1-3 only the code and/or text needs to be included in the homework submission (no data/result files). For details see below.\nB. Read counting for different feature types   Task 4: Compute strand-specific count tables for the positive (sense) strand of the following feature types. The help files of ?exonsBy and ?transcripts provide useful information for solving these tasks.\n Genes Exons Exons by genes Introns by transcripts 5'-UTRs by transcripts    Note, for Tasks 4 only include the code and/or text in your homework submission (no data/result files).

Use in one case for the DEG analysis the unstranded count table as input (from Task 1.1) and in another the sense strand count table (from Task 1.2). Compare the DEG result of the two methods in two separate 4-way Venn diagrams for the same sample comparisons used in the workflow example here.\n 4-way Venn diagram for unstranded count table 4-way Venn diagram for sense strand count table    Note, for Tasks 5 include both the code and the resulting images in your homework submission. For deteails see below.\nHomework submission Accept the project repos on Github Classroom\nStarting with this homework, you will use a classroom repository called project. This repository will be used until the end of this class for all remaining homework assignments as well as the course project. You are responsible to maintain this project repository including its README.md file.\n To start with HW7, accept the assignment and git clone to your user account on the HPCC cluster or your local computer. Create a directory “hw7” and upload all your HW7 script and result files to this directory. This includes the following files:  Your script file either as R or R Markdown file, here hw7.R or hw7.Rmd. Two Venn diagram plots: unstranded.png and hw7/sense.png    Auto-grading You will complete most of your HW7 on the HPCC cluster. In this and the following homeworks auto-grading will not be used.\nYour TA will manually check your homework solutions.\nDetails  If you wish then you can submit your homeworks as an R Markdown (Rmd) file. However, an R file will be sufficient. Due to dependencies of large input/result files there is also no need to make sure your code can be sourced with source(). Another option will be to add your homework code to the systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd file used in the corresponding workflow template and rename it to hw7.Rmd when you upload it to GitHub. If possible please use only one of the above format options.  For the graphis files, you can upload them either as .png or .jpg (.jpeg) files.\nGrading  Task1  Unstranded: 1 Positive: 1 Negative: 1   Task2: 1 Task3: 1 Task4  Genes: 0.5 Exons: 0.5 Exons by genes: 0.5 Introns by transcripts: 0.5 5'-UTRs by transcripts: 0.5   Task5  DEG: 1 Venn1: 1 Venn2: 1    Total: 10.5\nDue date This homework is due in one week on Thu, May 6th at 6:00 PM.

Open with vim/nvim the Rmd file located in the root directory of the chosen workflow. Next make the following changes (1.-8.) to the R Markdown file, render it to HTML and PDF format, and then submit the rendered report along with the corresponding Rmd source file to GitHub Classroom as instructed below. The changes to include in the R Markdown are:\nTasks\nRead the basics of Rmarkdown formatting.\n In the section relating to your challenge project, add a short paragraph describing the analysis steps you have chosen to perform as part of your challenge project. In the challenge project section, cite the reference(s) of the paper(s) you have chosen to present in class as part of your course project. For this add the reference in BibTeX format to the bibtex.tex file located in the root directory of the workflow, and then cite it in the text of the Rmd file so that the properly rendered citation shows up in the text and the corresponding reference is get automatically added to the reference list when running rmarkdown::render. Note, references in BibTeX format can be obtained from Google Scholar, Paperpile or most other reference management software. More detailed information about managing references in R Markdown files is here. Add a mathematical equation to the challenge project section. Evaluate an R expression in the text as inline R code (see here) of your challenge project, e.g. mathematical or number from an existing R oject such as mean value of the first column of the iris data.frame. Add a code chunk that auto-generates the barplot for HW3C. This barplot should be embedded in the rendered report without saving it intermediately to a file. Insert the targets file of your workflow (default toy data is sufficient) as an interactive table using the DT package. An example is given in the table section of the R Markdown manual here. Use the rmarkdown::render() function to render the report to both HTML and PDF formats (details are here). Important: for this assignment it is not relevant to evaluate the code chunks for the actual analysis steps of the analysis workflow. Only the chunks required for the above tasks need to be evaluated. Also, when embedding the targets file under step 6 into the report, the interactive table generated by the DT package can only be included in the HTML version of the report. To including this table in the PDF version of the report, use the static knitr::kable option instead as outlined here. Submit the Rmd, PDF and HTML file for the report to the corresponding repos on GitHub Classroom (see below).  Homework submission Use your GitHub Classroom repository from the last time, the project repository. Create a directory /hw8 and upload your files in there.\n Your Rmarkdown file, name it hw8.Rmd. HTML rendered file, name it hw8.html. PDF rendered file, name it hw8.pdf.  bibtex file is not required.\nGrading  Upload Rmd: 1 Upload HTML: 1 Upload PDF: 1 Step 1-6: 1 each  Total 9\nDue date This homework is due in one week on Thu, May 13th at 6:00 PM.\nHomework Solutions All solutions for HW08 can be looked up in the R Markdown tutorial of this class. The source code is available in the Rmd file and the rendered result in the corresponding HTML file. As in all tutorial pages of this site, the Rmd files can also be accessed via a link located in the header section of each tutorial page.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"\n\nRender R Markdown (Rmd) of your project Students will choose for …","ref":"/assignments/homework/hw08/hw08/","tags":"","title":"HW8 - R Markdown Template of Course Project"},{"body":"Projects will be posted here.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Projects will be posted here.\n","ref":"/assignments/projects/","tags":"","title":"Projects"},{"body":"\n\nIntroduction During the tutorial sessions of this class all students will perform the basic data analysis of at least two NGS Workflows including RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq (or ATAC-Seq). In addition, every student will work on a Challenge Project addressing a specific data analysis task within one of the general NGS Workflows. Students will also present a scientific paper closely related to their challenge topic (see here). To facilitate teamwork and communication with instructors, each course project will be assigned a private GitHub repository.\nThe results of the Challenge Projects will be presented by each student during the last week of the course (see Slideshow Template here). In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report for the assigned course project. This report needs to include all analysis steps of the corresponding NGS Workflow (e.g. full RNA-Seq analysis) as well as the code and results of the Challenge Project. The final project reports will be written in R Markdown. A basic tutorial on R Markdown is available here. Both the R Markdown script (.Rmd) along with the rendered HTML or PDF report will be submitted to each student’s private GitHub repository. All helper code used for the challenge project needs to be organized as well documented R functions in each project’s *_Fct.R script. The expected structure of the final project report is outlined below.\nThe reports should be submitted to each student’s private GitHub repository that was used to submit the homework assignments.

The full path to these directories should look like this:\n /bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/data /bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/results  GitHub repositories for projects Students will work on their course projects within GitHub repositories, one for each student. These project repositories are private and have been shared with each student via GitHub Classroom. To populate a course project with an initial project workflow, please follow the instructions given.\nGenerate workflow environment with project data  Log in to the HPCC cluster and set your working directory to bigdata or (/bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e) Clone the GitHub repository for your project with git clone ... (URLs listed here) and then cd into this directory. Generate the workflow environment for your project on the HPCC cluster with genWorkenvir from systemPipeRdata. Delete the default data and results directories and replace them with symbolic links pointing to the above described data and results directories of your course project. For instance, the project RNA-Seq should create the symbolic links for their data and results directories like this: ln -s /bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/data data ln -s /bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/results results   Add the workflow directory to the GitHub repository of your project with git add -A and the run commit and push as outlined in the GitHub instructions of this course here. Download the FASTQ files of your project with getSRAfastq (see below) to the data directory of your project, here ‘/bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/data’. Generate a proper targets file for your project where the first column(s) point(s) to the downloaded FASTQ files. In addition, provide sample names matching the experimental design (columns: SampleNames and Factor). More details about the structure of targets files are provided here. Ready to use targets files for both the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq project can be downloaded as tab separated (TSV) files from here. Alternatively, one can download the corresponding Google Sheets with the read_sheet function from the googlesheets4 package (RNA-Seq GSheet and ChIP-Seq GSheet). Inspect and adjust the .param files you will be using. For instance, make sure the software modules you are loading and the path to the reference genome are correct. Every time you start working on your project you cd into the directory of the repository and then run git pull to get the latest change. When you are done, you commit and push your changes back to GitHub with git commit -am \"some edits\"; git push -u origin main.  Download of project data Open R from within the GitHub respository of your project and then run the following code section, but only those that apply to your project.\nFASTQ files from SRA Choose FASTQ data for your project  The FASTQ files for the ChIP-Seq project are from SRA study SRP002174 (Kaufman et al. 2010)  sraidv \u003c- paste(\"SRR0388\", 45:51, sep=\"\")   The FASTQ files for the RNA-Seq project are from SRA study SRP010938 (Howard et al. 2013)  sraidv \u003c- paste(\"SRR4460\", 27:44, sep=\"\")  Load libraries and modules library(systemPipeR) moduleload(\"sratoolkit/2.9.2\") system('fastq-dump --help') # prints help to screen  Redirect cache output of SRA Toolkit Newer versions of the SRA Toolkit create a cache directory (named ncbi) in the highest level of a user’s home directory. To save space in home accounts (limited to 20GB), users need to redirect this output to their project’s data directory via a symbolic link. The following shows how to do this for the data directory of the ChIP-Seq project.\nsystem(\"ln -s /bigdata/gen242/\u003cuser_name\u003e/projdata/data ~/ncbi\")  Define download function The following function downloads and extracts the FASTQ files for each project from SRA. Internally, it uses the fastq-dump utility of the SRA Toolkit from NCBI.\ngetSRAfastq \u003c- function(sraid, targetdir, maxreads=\"1000000000\") { system(paste(\"fastq-dump --split-files --gzip --maxSpotId\", maxreads, sraid, \"--outdir\", targetdir)) }  Run download Note the following performs the download in serialized mode for the chosen data set and saves the extracted FASTQ files to the path specified under targetdir.\nmydir \u003c- getwd(); setwd(\"data\") for(i in sraidv) getSRAfastq(sraid=i, targetdir=\".\") setwd(mydir)  Alternatively, the download can be performed in parallelized mode with BiocParallel. Please run this version only on one of the compute nodes.\nmydir \u003c- getwd(); setwd(\"data\") # bplapply(sraidv, getSRAfastq, targetdir=\".\", BPPARAM = MulticoreParam(workers=4)) setwd(mydir)  Download reference genome and annotation The following downloadRefs function downloads the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence and GFF file from the TAIR FTP site. It also assigns consistent chromosome identifiers to make them the same among both the genome sequence and the GFF file. This is important for many analysis routines such as the read counting in the RNA-Seq workflow.\ndownloadRefs \u003c- function(rerun=FALSE) { if(rerun==TRUE) { library(Biostrings) download.file(\"https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_chromosome_files/TAIR10_chr_all.fas\", \"./data/tair10.fasta\") dna \u003c- readDNAStringSet(\"./data/tair10.fasta\") names(dna) \u003c- paste(rep(\"Chr\", 7), c(1:5, \"M\", \"C\"), sep=\"\") # Fixes chromomse ids writeXStringSet(dna, \"./data/tair10.fasta\") download.file(\"https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_gff3/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff\", \"./data/tair10.gff\") download.file(\"https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_functional_descriptions\", \"./data/tair10_functional_descriptions\") } }  After importing/sourcing the above function, execute it as follows:\ndownloadRefs(rerun=TRUE)  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"\n\nShared big data space on HPCC All larger data sets of the coure …","ref":"/assignments/projects/project_data/","tags":"","title":"Data Management for Course Projects"},{"body":"Presentation will be posted here.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Presentation will be posted here.\n","ref":"/assignments/presentations/","tags":"","title":"Project and Paper Presentations"},{"body":"Overview Each student has been assigned one journal publication to present in class.

It consists of three main components: lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis, phylogenetics, comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, network biology and more. The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and course projects focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data using command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R. Depending on student interests, one or more specialty topics may be included, such as the analysis of single cell (e.g. scRNA-Seq) experiments, multi-omics data, or the development of web-based analysis tools (e.g. Shiny Apps).  Who should take this class? Students with a strong interest and motivation in acquiring the skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern genome research. The class is mainly targeting graduate students but senior undergraduate students are welcome to enroll as well. The main audience of this class usually includes students from bioscience, biomedical and bioengineering programs as well as CS and statistics students with interest in computational biology.  Can I audit this class? It is possible to audit this class. However, due to the emphasis on active participation in practicals and course projects, students usually learn much more if they enroll into the class rather than auditing it in a passive manner.
